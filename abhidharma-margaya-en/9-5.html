      <p>The thing that helps another thing to arise is called 'Condition' (Paccaya). It is not wrong to say that the
        thing that produces another thing is a 'Condition'. The thing that has arisen with the help of another is called
        'Conditionally Arisen' (Paccayuppanna). It is also suitable to say that the thing produced by another thing is
        'Conditionally Arisen'. Fire arises with the help of the substance on the tip of the matchstick and the
        substance coated on the matchbox. The two types of substances on the matchstick and the matchbox that helped the
        fire to arise, or produced the fire, are the Condition. The fire is the Conditionally Arisen. Thus, Condition
        and Conditionally Arisen should be understood separately.</p>
      <p>The substance coated on the matchstick helps the fire to arise in one way. The substance coated on the matchbox
        helps in another way. If the medicine on the matchstick and the medicine on the matchbox helped the fire to
        arise in the exact same way, fire could arise from just one of them. It is not so because two helps with
        distinct modes are needed for the fire to arise. Just as there are two modes of being a condition in the
        matchbox and the matchstick, it should be known that there are various modes of helping other things in the
        manifold objects in the world. Those special modes of helping are called 'Conditioning Force' (Paccaya Satti).
      </p>
      <p>The ultimate realities - Consciousness (Citta), Mental Factors (Cetasika), and Matter (Rupa) - arise from
        conditions. Nirvana and Concepts (Pannatti) do not arise from conditions. There are conditioning forces in all
        things, both those that arise from conditions and those that do not arise from conditions. There is no dharma
        whatsoever that does not have some conditioning force. A single dharma does not have just one conditioning
        force. Some dharmas have many conditioning forces. Some dharmas have few conditioning forces.</p>
      <p>In the entire group of dharmas existing as ultimate realities and concepts, belonging to the past, future,
        present, and released from the three times, there are twenty-four conditioning forces. According to those
        conditioning forces, the aforementioned group of dharmas has been divided into twenty-four parts in the Patthana
        Mahapakarana under the name of Conditions. The twenty-four parts are called 'Twenty-four Conditions'. The text
        in the Patthana Pali showing the twenty-four conditions is as follows:-</p>

      <p><b>Lesson 6</b></p>
      <p><b>(1) Hetu Paccaya (Root Condition)</b></p>
      <p>The dharma that helps by way of being a root is the Hetu Paccaya. Here, the state of being a root means the
        state of a root (mula). Just as a root penetrates the earth and helps the tree to stand without falling, the
        dharma that penetrates the object and helps the dharmas arising together with it to stand firmly in the object
        without shaking is the Hetu Paccaya. The six dharmas - Greed (Lobha), Hatred (Dosa), Delusion (Moha), Non-greed
        (Alobha), Non-hatred (Adosa), and Non-delusion (Amoha) - are Hetu Paccaya. The seventy-one rooted
        consciousnesses, the fifty-two mental factors excluding the delusion arising in the delusion-rooted
        consciousness, rooted mind-produced matter, and rooted rebirth-linking consciousness and the kamma-produced
        matter arising with it - these are the Paccayuppanna (Conditionally Arisen) of the Hetu Paccaya.</p>
      <p>By excluding delusion in the delusion-rooted consciousness, the count of mental factors does not decrease
        because the delusion arising in greed-rooted and hatred-rooted consciousnesses is taken. The delusion in the
        delusion-rooted consciousness is a condition by way of root to the delusion-rooted consciousness and to the
        other mental factors arising with it. Since there is no other root dharma there to be a condition by way of root
        to that delusion, the delusion in the delusion-root is not Hetu Paccayuppanna. In consciousnesses with two or
        three roots, the root dharmas are Paccayuppanna. Because one of the root dharmas arising together becomes a
        condition to the other by way of root.</p>
      <p><b>(2) Arammana Paccaya (Object Condition)</b></p>
      <p>The dharma that helps by way of being an object is the Arammana Paccaya. Consciousness and mental factors
        cannot arise without taking an object. Therefore, every object is a help for the arising of consciousness and
        mental factors.</p>
      <p>The eighty-nine consciousnesses, fifty-two mental factors, twenty-eight materialities, Nirvana, and Concepts -
        all these are Arammana Paccaya. There is nothing that is not an Arammana Paccaya.</p>
      <p>The eighty-nine consciousnesses and fifty-two mental factors are Arammana Paccayuppanna.</p>
      <p><b>(3) Adhipati Paccaya (Predominance Condition)</b></p>
      <p>The dharma that helps by way of predominance is the Adhipati Paccaya. The state of predominance is the nature
        of making others conform to oneself. Some dharmas have a nature of making other dharmas conform to them. The
        name 'Adhipati' is used for those dharmas here. Adhipati Paccaya is twofold as 'Arammanadhipati' and
        'Sahajatadhipati'. Some objects have a nature of attracting the mind. Therefore, many minds arise bending and
        inclining towards that object. That nature of attracting the mind is the Adhipati nature in the object.</p>
      <p><b>Arammanadhipati Paccaya</b></p>
      <p>The eighteen concretely produced matter (nipphanna rupa) which are desirable and worthy of respect, the
        remaining eighty-four consciousnesses excluding the two hatred-rooted, two delusion-rooted, and pain-accompanied
        body consciousness, the remaining forty-seven mental factors excluding hatred, envy, stinginess, worry, and
        doubt, and Nirvana - these dharmas are Arammanadhipati Paccaya dharmas.</p>
      <p>The twenty-eight consciousnesses - eight greed-rooted consciousnesses, eight great wholesome consciousnesses,
        four great functional knowledge-associated consciousnesses, and eight supramundane consciousnesses - which take
        those dharmas as object with respect, and the remaining forty-five mental factors excluding hatred, envy,
        stinginess, worry, doubt, compassion, and appreciative joy - these are Arammanadhipati Paccayuppanna.</p>
      <p><b>Sahajatadhipati Paccaya</b></p>
      <p>The four predominant dharmas - Desire (Chanda), Mind (Citta), Energy (Viriya), and Investigation (Vimamsa) -
        are called Sahajatadhipati because they are conditions by way of predominance to those associated with them. At
        one time, only one of these four becomes predominant. Two or three do not become predominant at once.</p>
      <p>The two-rooted and three-rooted Javana consciousnesses, and Desire, Energy, and Investigation - these become
        Adhipati Paccaya at the occasion when each of them is predominant.</p>
      <p>The fifty-two Adhipati Javanas excluding the dharma that is predominant at that respective occasion, the mental
        factors other than doubt, and the matter produced by those consciousnesses - these are Sahajatadhipati
        Paccayuppanna.</p>
      <p><b>4.5 Anantara - Samanantara Paccaya (Proximity - Contiguity Conditions)</b></p>
      <p>In the stream of consciousness existing in beings, subsequent consciousnesses arise because of the preceding
        consciousnesses. If there were no preceding consciousnesses, subsequent consciousnesses would not arise. Every
        consciousness has a nature of helping another consciousness to arise without allowing the place to become empty
        immediately upon its own cessation, so that no gap is felt. Therefore, as soon as one consciousness ceases,
        another consciousness arises. The power in the ceasing preceding consciousnesses to produce another
        consciousness right next to them is the Anantara power. The dharma that helps by Anantara power is called
        Anantara Paccaya. There is also a nature in the ceasing consciousnesses to help the consciousness arising
        subsequent to it to arise suitably for the place. That is called Samanantara power. The dharma that helps by
        Samanantara power is Samanantara Paccaya. Both Anantara and Samanantara powers are in the same consciousness.
        Therefore, every consciousness and every mental factor that ceases, except the Arahat's death consciousness
        (Cuti), is both Anantara Paccaya and Samanantara Paccaya. All consciousnesses and mental factors arising
        subsequently, including the Arahat's death consciousness, are Anantara Paccayuppanna and Samanantara
        Paccayuppanna.</p>
      <p><b>Lesson 7</b></p>
      <p><b>6. Sahajata Paccaya (Conascence Condition)</b></p>
      <p>The dharma that helps other dharmas to arise together with itself when it arises is the Sahajata Paccaya.</p>
      <p>The eighty-nine consciousnesses and fifty-two mental factors which are conditions to each other and to
        mind-produced matter and rebirth kamma-produced matter; the four great elements which are conditions to each
        other and to derived matter; the heart base which is a condition to the five-aggregate rebirth mental aggregates
        - these are Sahajata Paccaya dharmas.</p>
      <p>The mental aggregates - eighty-nine consciousnesses and fifty-two mental factors - which receive help from each
        other; the great elements with derived matter which receive help from each other; the five-aggregate rebirth
        mental aggregates which receive help from the heart base; the heart base which receives help from the
        five-aggregate rebirth mental aggregates - these are the Paccayuppanna of the Sahajata Paccaya.</p>
      <p><b>7. Annamanna Paccaya (Mutuality Condition)</b></p>
      <p>The dharma that helps a certain dharma while receiving help from that dharma is the Annamanna Paccaya. The
        eighty-nine consciousnesses and fifty-two mental factors which help each other; the four great elements which
        help each other; the five-aggregate rebirth mental aggregates and the heart base which help each other - these
        are Annamanna Paccaya dharmas. Those same dharmas which receive help mutually are Annamanna Paccayuppanna.</p>
      <p><b>8. Nissaya Paccaya (Dependence Condition)</b></p>
      <p>Just as paper etc. help a painting etc. [to exist], the dharma that helps another dharma to stand by being a
        support is the Nissaya Paccaya. Nissaya Paccaya is twofold as Sahajata Nissaya and Purejata Nissaya. Dharmas
        that become a support while arising together with the Paccayuppanna are called Sahajata Nissaya. Dharmas that
        become a support to subsequent dharmas by arising first are called Purejata Nissaya.</p>
      <p>The Paccaya and Paccayuppanna of Sahajata Nissaya Paccaya should be known as in Sahajata Paccaya.</p>
      <p>Purejata Nissaya is also twofold as Vatthu Purejata Nissaya and Vattharammana Purejata Nissaya. During the
        course of existence (pavatti), the six bases such as the eye base are Vatthu Purejata Nissaya Paccaya. The
        remaining consciousnesses and mental factors excluding formless results are Paccayuppanna. (Vattharammana
        Purejata Paccaya is not shown as it is difficult to understand.)</p>
      <p><b>9. Upanissaya Paccaya (Decisive Support Condition)</b></p>
      <p>The dharma that is a strong help for the arising of a certain dharma is the Upanissaya Paccaya. Nissaya Paccaya
        is of three types: Arammanopanissaya, Anantaropanissaya, and Pakatupanissaya.</p>
      <p>The object which is respected by the world as a good thing is Arammanopanissaya Paccaya. The Paccaya dharmas
        and Paccayuppanna dharmas therein are as in Arammanadhipati.</p>
      <p>The consciousness that arose and ceased immediately before a consciousness arises is the Anantaropanissaya
        Paccaya. Since a consciousness cannot arise without it even if other conditions like Arammana exist, the
        consciousness ceased in the immediate proximity is a strong help to the subsequent consciousness. The Paccaya
        and Paccayuppanna in Anantaropanissaya are as in Anantara Paccaya.</p>
      <p>Dharmas such as lust (raga) etc. and faith (saddha) etc. that arose in a continuum, and pleasure and pain etc.,
        become a special cause for the arising of many consciousnesses and mental factors in that continuum in the
        future. Those dharmas such as lust are Pakatupanissaya Paccaya.</p>
      <p>The eighty-nine consciousnesses, fifty-two mental factors, twenty-eight materialities, and certain concepts are
        dharmas that become Pakatupanissaya Paccaya. The eighty-nine consciousnesses and fifty-two mental factors
        arising because of them are Paccayuppanna.</p>
      <p><b>10. Purejata Paccaya (Prenascence Condition)</b></p>
      <p>The dharma that helps subsequent dharmas by arising earlier is the Purejata Paccaya. Purejata Paccaya is of
        three types: Vatthu Purejata Paccaya, Vattharammana Purejata Paccaya, and Arammana Purejata Paccaya. Of these,
        Vatthu Purejata Paccaya is like Vatthu Purejata Nissaya Paccaya. Vattharammana Purejata Paccaya is like
        Vattharammana Purejata Nissaya Paccaya. The eighteen concretely produced matter which arise earlier and become
        conditions to subsequent consciousnesses and mental factors are Arammana Purejata Paccaya. The fifty-four
        sense-sphere consciousnesses arising in the five-aggregate plane, the two supernormal knowledge consciousnesses,
        and the fifty mental factors excluding illimitables are Paccayuppanna.</p>
      <p><b>11. Pacchajata Paccaya (Postnascence Condition)</b></p>
      <p>The subsequent consciousnesses and mental factors that give support to the material dharmas that arose earlier
        and are existing are Pacchajata Paccaya.</p>
      <p>The eighty-five subsequent consciousnesses such as the first Bhavanga excluding formless results arising in the
        five-aggregate plane, and the fifty-two mental factors are Pacchajata Paccaya dharmas. The matter that arose
        with the rebirth-linking etc. and has reached the static phase are Paccayuppanna. This condition is not a
        condition that produces the Paccayuppanna, but a condition that only gives support to it.</p>
      <p><b>12. Asevana Paccaya (Repetition Condition)</b></p>
      <p>Just as the paint applied first takes its own nature and helps the paint applied later to be brilliant, the
        preceding consciousnesses that help the subsequent consciousnesses to become strong by taking their own nature
        are Asevana Paccaya. Asevana exists in Javana consciousnesses.</p>
      <p>The forty-seven mundane Javanas and fifty-two mental factors arising first, excluding the last Javana and Fruit
        Javana, are Asevana Paccaya dharmas. The subsequent Javana consciousnesses and mental factors, excluding the
        first Javana and Fruit Javanas, are Paccayuppanna.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Lesson 8</b></li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>13. Kamma Paccaya (Kamma Condition)</b></p>
      <p>The volition (cetana) mental factor which is the effort of performing respective actions is called Kamma
        Paccaya. Kamma Paccaya is two: Sahajata Kamma Paccaya and Nanakshanika Kamma Paccaya. Volition is a universal
        mental factor. It arises producing the mind, other mental factors, and a group of matter. Since the volition
        thus arising is a condition to the dharmas arising with it, it is called Sahajata Kamma Paccaya. The volitions
        in the eighty-nine consciousnesses are all Sahajata Kamma Paccaya. The eighty-nine consciousnesses, the
        remaining fifty-one mental factors excluding volition, mind-produced matter, and rebirth kamma-produced matter
        are the Paccayuppanna of Sahajata Kamma Paccaya.</p>
      <p>The collection of wholesome and unwholesome volitions that produce their result in the future, or in other
        words, the thirty-three past wholesome and unwholesome volitions, are Nanakshanika Kamma Paccaya. The thirty-six
        resultant consciousnesses, thirty-eight mental factors, and eighteen kamma-produced matter are the Paccayuppanna
        of Nanakshanika Kamma Paccaya. Since the moment the condition arises and the moment the Paccayuppanna arises are
        different, this condition is called Nanakshanika Kamma Paccaya.</p>
      <p><b>14. Vipaka Paccaya (Result Condition)</b></p>
      <p>The dharma that helps the dharmas arising with it to arise in an effortless, peaceful state by being in an
        effortless, peaceful state itself is the Vipaka Paccaya. The thirty-six resultant consciousnesses and
        thirty-eight mental factors which are conditions to each other and to mind-produced matter and rebirth
        kamma-produced matter are Vipaka Paccaya dharmas.</p>
      <p>The thirty-six resultant consciousnesses and thirty-eight mental factors which receive help from each other,
        mind-produced matter other than intimation matter produced by resultant consciousnesses, and rebirth
        kamma-produced matter are the Paccayuppanna of Vipaka Paccaya.</p>
      <p><b>15. Ahara Paccaya (Nutriment Condition)</b></p>
      <p>The mental and material dharmas having the nature of producing certain mind and matter and giving support to
        the mind and matter series produced by conditions such as Kamma to exist for a long time are known by the name
        Ahara Paccaya. The main thing done by Ahara Paccaya is giving support to mind-matter series. In other words, it
        is giving support for the being to live for a long time.</p>
      <p>Ahara Paccaya is two: Namahara Paccaya and Rupahara Paccaya. The three dharmas Contact, Volition, and
        Consciousness are Namahara Paccaya. The eighty-nine consciousnesses, fifty-two mental factors, mind-produced
        matter, and rebirth kamma-produced matter are the Paccayuppanna of Namahara Paccaya.</p>
      <p>The nutritive essence (oja) matter in food etc. called Kabalinkarahara is Rupahara Paccaya. The matter produced
        by nutriment are its Paccayuppanna.</p>
      <p><b>16. Indriya Paccaya (Faculty Condition)</b></p>
      <p>The dharma that helps by way of governing (ruling) is Indriya Paccaya. Indriya Paccaya is three: Sahajatindriya
        Paccaya, Purejatindriya Paccaya, and Rupajivitindriya Paccaya.</p>
      <p>The mental faculties - Mind, Feeling, Faith, Energy, Mindfulness, One-pointedness, Wisdom - are Sahajata
        Indriya Paccaya dharmas. The eighty-nine consciousnesses, fifty-two mental factors, mind-produced matter, and
        rebirth kamma-produced matter are its Paccayuppanna.</p>
      <p>The five sensitive matter - Eye, Ear, Nose, Tongue, Body - are Purejatindriya Paccaya. The two fivefold
        consciousnesses and the seven universal mental factors are its Paccayuppanna.</p>
      <p>The life faculty matter is Rupajivitindriya Paccaya. The matter other than life faculty matter in
        kamma-produced material groups are its Paccayuppanna.</p>
      <p><b>17. Jhana Paccaya (Jhana Condition)</b></p>
      <p>Dharmas such as Vitakka which have a special effort of taking the object are called Jhana. Due to that special
        effort of taking the object of dharmas such as Vitakka, other dharmas arise in accordance with it. Since they
        are the cause for the arising of such arising dharmas, Vitakka etc. are called Jhana Paccaya.</p>
      <p>The five Jhana factors - Vitakka, Vicara, Vedana, Piti, Ekaggata - in the seventy-nine consciousnesses other
        than the two fivefold consciousnesses are Jhana Paccaya. The seventy-nine consciousnesses other than the two
        fivefold consciousnesses, fifty-two mental factors, and mind-produced and rebirth kamma-produced matter are the
        Paccayuppanna of Jhana Paccaya.</p>
      <p><b>Lesson 9</b></p>
      <p><b>18. Magga Paccaya (Path Condition)</b></p>
      <p>The dharmas that are conditions to the conascent mind and matter by the special power of leading to a happy
        state, unhappy state, or Nirvana are Magga Paccaya.</p>
      <p>The nine path factor dharmas - Wisdom, Applied Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Energy,
        Mindfulness, One-pointedness, View - arising in rooted consciousnesses are Magga Paccaya. The seventy-one rooted
        consciousnesses, fifty-two mental factors, rooted mind-produced matter, and rooted rebirth kamma-produced matter
        are the Paccayuppanna of Magga Paccaya.</p>
      <p><b>19. Sampayutta Paccaya (Association Condition)</b></p>
      <p>The dharma that helps by coming to a state of mixture without a gap is the Sampayutta Paccaya. The mental
        dharmas - eighty-nine consciousnesses and fifty-two mental factors - which are conditions to each other are
        Sampayutta Paccaya dharmas. The consciousness and mental factor dharmas receiving help from each other are its
        Paccayuppanna.</p>
      <p><b>20. Vippayutta Paccaya (Dissociation Condition)</b></p>
      <p>The dharma that is a condition by not mixing with each other although existing in contact is the Vippayutta
        Paccaya. Vippayutta Paccaya is three: Sahajata Vippayutta, Purejata Vippayutta, and Pacchajata Vippayutta.</p>
      <p>The seventy-five consciousnesses other than formless results, two fivefold consciousnesses, and Arahat's death
        consciousness arising in the five-aggregate plane, the fifty-two mental factors, the heart base which is a
        condition to the five-aggregate rebirth mental aggregates, and the five-aggregate rebirth mental aggregates
        which are conditions to the heart base - these are Sahajata Vippayutta Paccaya dharmas.</p>
      <p>Mind-produced matter, rebirth kamma-produced matter, five-aggregate rebirth mental aggregates receiving help
        from the heart base, and the heart base receiving help from the five-aggregate rebirth mental aggregates - these
        are the Paccayuppanna of Sahajata Vippayutta Paccaya.</p>
      <p>Purejata Vippayutta should be known as Purejata Paccaya, and Pacchajata Vippayutta as Pacchajata Paccaya.</p>
      <p><b>21. Atthi Paccaya (Presence Condition)</b></p>
      <p>The very presence of some dharma is the cause for the arising of another dharma. The dharma that helps by way
        of presence is Atthi Paccaya. Atthi Paccaya is sevenfold: Sahajatatthi Paccaya, Vatthu Purejatatthi Paccaya,
        Vattharammana Purejatatthi Paccaya, Arammana Purejatatthi Paccaya, Pacchajatatthi Paccaya, Aharatthi Paccaya,
        and Indriyatthi Paccaya. Their Paccaya and Paccayuppanna should be known just as in those respective conditions.
      </p>
      <p><b>22. Natthi Paccaya (Absence Condition)</b></p>
      <p>Where one thing exists, there is no room for another. Therefore, the absence of something is a help for the
        arising of another there. The dharma that helps the arising of another by disappearing by way of cessation is
        Natthi Paccaya. Its Paccaya and Paccayuppanna should be known as in Anantara Paccaya.</p>
      <p><b>23, 24. Vigata - Avigata Paccaya (Disappearance - Non-disappearance Conditions)</b></p>
      <p>The dharmas that help another to appear in its place by disappearance, i.e., by its own absence, are Vigata
        Paccaya. The dharma that helps another to arise by non-disappearance, i.e., by existing state, is Avigata
        Paccaya. There is no difference between Atthi and Avigata in terms of dharmas and powers. Similarly, there is no
        difference between Natthi and Vigata. It is a custom of the Tathagata to preach the same matter preached once in
        other words in some places. This is also such a place. He does so according to the individuals who understand
        the matter when said in those respective words.</p>
      <p><b>One Dharma - Multiple Conditions</b></p>
      <p><b>Manifold Condition State</b></p>
      <p>If one examines the Paccaya and Paccayuppanna shown so far, it will be seen that a single dharma belongs to
        many conditions, and similarly, belongs to the Paccayuppanna of many conditions. From that, it should be
        understood that one ultimate reality has many conditioning forces, that the same dharma becomes a condition by
        many conditioning forces, and that each dharma arises from many conditions.</p>
      <p>It should be known that the Greed mental factor, which is a condition to associated dharmas by Hetu power, is a
        condition to associated dharmas by Hetu power, and also by Sahajata, Annamanna, Sahajata Nissaya, Sampayutta,
        Atthi, and Avigata powers.</p>
      <p>That Greed mental factor is Hetu Paccayuppanna because of the Delusion root associated with it. It is also
        Paccayuppanna of Arammana, Adhipati, Anantara, Samanantara, Sahajata, Annamanna, Nissaya, Upanissaya, Asevana,
        Kamma, Ahara, Indriya, Jhana, Magga, Sampayutta, Atthi, and Avigata conditions.</p>
      <p>Thus, the state of being a condition and the state of being conditionally arisen of respective dharmas should
        be found.</p>
