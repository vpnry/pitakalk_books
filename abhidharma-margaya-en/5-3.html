        <h2>3. Classification of Objects</h2><i class="material-icons share-icon" file-name="5-3.html">share</i>
      </div>
      <p>There are four types of objects that come to the five doors: “Atimahantarammana, Mahantarammana,
        Parittarammana, Atiparittarammana”. There are two parts of objects that come to the mind door: Vibhutarammana
        and Avibhutarammana. Thus, there are six types of objects that come to the six doors.</p>
      <p>The object that is very clear due to largeness or being well lit or being close is called <b>Atimahanta</b>.
        The object not as clear as Atimahantarammana is called <b>Mahanta</b>. The object not as clear as Mahantarammana
        is called <b>Paritta</b>. The unclear object is called <b>Atiparitta</b>.</p>
      <p>The Rupa does not strike the doors at its arising moment. The Rupa that strikes the doors is the one that has
        reached the static stage. The object that strikes the doors in the second Citta Khana after arising and passing
        one Citta Khana (three small Khanas) is Atimahantarammana. The object that strikes the doors after passing two
        or three Citta Khanas is called Mahanta. The objects that strike the door after passing four, five, six, seven,
        eight, nine Citta Khanas are called Paritta. The object that strikes the door after passing from ten to fifteen
        Citta Khanas is called Atiparitta.</p>
      <p>In Atimahantarammana, many Vithi Cittas arise. In Mahantarammana, a lesser number of Vithi Cittas arise. In
        Parittarammana, an even lesser number of Vithi Cittas arise. In Atiparittarammana, only Bhavanga Calana occurs.
        Vithi Cittas do not arise.</p>
      <p><b>Vithi</b></p>
      <p>Vithis are of two parts as Pancadvara Vithi - Manodvara Vithi. Pancadvara Vithis are also of five parts as
        Cakkhudvara Vithi - Sotadvara Vithi - Ghanadvara Vithi - Jivhadvara Vithi - Kayadvara Vithi. Cakkhudvara Vithis
        are also of four parts as Atimahantarammana Vithi - Mahantarammana Vithi - Parittarammana Vithi -
        Atiparittarammana Vithi. In Cakkhudvara, there is one Atimahantarammana Vithi. There are two Mahantarammana
        Vithis. There are six Parittarammana Vithis. There are six Atiparittarammana Vithis. All are fifteen. Sota -
        Ghana - Jivha - Kayadvara Vithis are also fifteen each. All Pancadvara Vithis are seventy-five.</p>
      <p><b>Mula Citta (Root Consciousness)</b></p>
      <p>At the moment of death, a Kamma done by the being is remembered. Or a Kamma Nimitta or Gati Nimitta appears.
        Taking the object that appeared to the mind at the moment of death as object, the first Citta of the second
        birth arises. It is called “Patisandhi Citta”. According to nature, even after that Patisandhi Citta ceases, a
        Citta similar to the Patisandhi Citta taking the object that was the object of the Maranasanna Citta arises
        again and again in that continuum until death. The being lives without the Citta lineage being broken because of
        that Citta lineage. Since they are the cause for the existence of the Bhava, those Cittas are called
        ‘<b>Bhavanga Cittas</b>’. Although Bhavanga Citta arises in beings at all times when there is no other Citta, we
        do not feel that such a Citta arises. That Bhavanga Citta is the root Citta of the being. Vithis taking new
        objects arise at the end of the Bhavanga Citta lineage.</p>
