      <p>The three types of Cittas, namely Rupavacara, Arupavacara, and Lokuttara, are a special group of Cittas that do
        not arise in ordinary people, but arise only in a few noble persons who have past merit, great effort, and have
        discarded sensual desires. Only Kamavacara Cittas arise in ordinary people. Even among them, <b>Hasituppada</b>
        and the <b>Eight Maha Kriya Cittas</b> do not arise in them.</p>
      <p>Rupavacara and similar Cittas are called "Jhana Cittas". They are very different from Kamavacara Cittas. They
        are superior. They are powerful. Psychic powers (Iddhi Pratiharya) can be performed by the power of those
        Cittas.</p>
      <p>Rupavacara Citta is divided into three parts as Kusala, Vipaka, and Kriya. Each part is again divided into five
        according to Jhanas. Thus, there are fifteen Rupavacara Cittas.</p>
      <p>Kamavacara Cittas have the strength to take the object only slightly. Jhana Cittas have the strength to take
        (know) the object well. Jhana Cittas take the object, such as a Kasina, very well and firmly, as if embracing
        it. The Jhana Citta can do so by the power of Jhana.</p>
      <p>There are five Jhanas: First Jhana, Second Jhana, Third Jhana, Fourth Jhana, and Fifth Jhana. They are groups
        of mental factors (Cetasikas). The main Jhana factor is powerful One-pointedness (Ekaggata). There is a weak
        One-pointedness in the mind of ordinary people as well. It is not capable of keeping the mind on one object for
        a long time. Jhana One-pointedness is capable of keeping the mind on one object for a long time. Those who have
        attained Jhana can keep their mind on the very same object for hours or even for the whole day.</p>
      <p>One-pointedness or Samadhi has five supporting factors: Vitakka (Applied Thought), Vicara (Sustained Thought),
        Piti (Joy), Sukha (Happiness), and Upekkha (Equanimity). Vitakka directs the meditator's mind to the object
        repeatedly without letting the Samadhi Citta retreat or contract. Vicara rubs the object. It invigorates the
        mind. It creates enjoyment through Happiness. With the help of the four factors like Vitakka, Samadhi becomes
        powerful and the First Jhana is formed. The First Jhana is the five factors: Vitakka, Vicara, Piti, Sukha, and
        Ekaggata, which are mutually connected.</p>
      <p>When the person who attained the First Jhana engages in meditation further, Samadhi develops to a state where
        it can be maintained without Vitakka. Then the Second Jhana arises in him, consisting of four factors: Vicara,
        Piti, Sukha, and Ekaggata. When the meditator meditates again, Samadhi gradually develops, and the Third Jhana
        consisting of three factors: Piti, Sukha, and Ekaggata arises; the Fourth Jhana consisting of two factors: Sukha
        and Ekaggata arises; and the Fifth Jhana consisting of two factors: Upekkha and Ekaggata arises. Cittas
        associated with Jhana are called 'Jhana Cittas'.</p>
      <p><b>The Five Rupavacara Kusala Cittas</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>First Jhana Citta with Vitakka, Vicara, Piti, Sukha, Ekaggata</b></li>
        <li><b>Second Jhana Citta with Vicara, Piti, Sukha, Ekaggata</b></li>
        <li><b>Third Jhana Citta with Piti, Sukha, Ekaggata</b></li>
        <li><b>Fourth Jhana Citta with Sukha, Ekaggata</b></li>
        <li><b>Fifth Jhana Citta with Upekkha, Ekaggata</b></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Thus, there are five Rupavacara Kusala Cittas.</p>
      <p><b>Rupavacara Vipaka Cittas</b></p>
      <p>If a person who has developed Rupavacara Jhanas passes away without falling from the Jhana, he will be born in
        the Brahma world without fail. Immediately after death, a Rupavacara Jhana Citta arises in the Brahma world by
        the power of his Rupavacara Kusala. The arising of that Citta there is the birth in the Brahma world. The Jhana
        Cittas that arise in the Brahma world after death by the power of those Kusala Jhana Cittas for those who have
        developed Rupavacara Kusala Jhanas are Rupavacara Vipaka Cittas. Since there is one Vipaka Citta for each Kusala
        Jhana Citta, there are five Rupavacara Vipaka Cittas such as <b>First Jhana Citta with Vitakka, Vicara, Piti,
          Sukha, Ekaggata</b>, etc.</p>
      <p><b>Rupavacara Kriya Cittas</b></p>
      <p>Arahants also sometimes develop Jhanas to live in the bliss of Jhana and to obtain the power of performing
        psychic miracles. Since the Rupavacara Jhana Cittas developed by Arahants do not have the power to produce
        future results, they are called Rupavacara Kriya. Rupavacara Kriya Cittas are also five, just like Kusala, such
        as <b>First Jhana Citta with Vitakka, Vicara, Piti, Sukha, Ekaggata</b>, etc.</p>
      <p>There are fifteen Rupavacara Cittas: five Kusala Cittas, five Vipaka Cittas, and five Kriya Cittas.</p>
      <p>In these Jhana Cittas, the word Sukha refers to Somanassa itself. Upekkha refers to Upekkha feeling. In these
        Cittas, the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Jhana Cittas are Somanassa-sahagata Cittas. In the fifteen
        Rupavacara Cittas, there are three of each Jhana Citta starting from the First. There are twelve
        Somanassa-sahagata Cittas. There are three Upekkha-sahagata Cittas.</p>
      <p>There is no special benefit obtained in learning Abhidhamma by investigating the Asankharika and Sasankharika
        nature of Rupavacara, Arupavacara, and Lokuttara Cittas. In classifying the nature, for the ease of counting
        Cittas, they are counted as Sasankharika Cittas.</p>
