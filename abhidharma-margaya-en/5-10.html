      <p>To have a good understanding of Manodvara Vithis, the occasions when they arise should be known. It was
        mentioned above that Saptarasayushka Vibhutarammana Avibhutarammana Manodvara Vithis arise taking as object the
        twenty-two present Rupas having a lifespan of seventeen Citta Khanas. The five objects Rupa, Sadda, Gandha,
        Rasa, Photthabba are included in those twenty-two Rupas.</p>
      <p>If you go to Ruwanweli Mahaseya, you see that great stupa. Seeing Ruwanweli Seya means nothing else but the
        arising of some Cakkhudvara Vithi in your continuity (Santana) taking Ruwanweli Seya as object.</p>
      <p>When you go home, you remember the Ruwanweli Mahaseya you saw. That remembering of Ruwanweli Mahaseya is the
        arising of a Manodvara Vithi taking as object the Ruwanweli Mahaseya you saw earlier.</p>
      <p>The Ruwanweli Seya you saw is a group of Rupas having a lifespan of seventeen Citta Khanas. That lifespan of
        seventeen Citta Khanas passed and that group of Rupas ceased immediately. Now they are not there. The object for
        the Manodvara Vithi arising in your continuity as remembering the seen Ruwanweli Seya is a past group of Rupas
        which you saw at that time and which are not there now. What arose in you at that time is one of the two
        Manodvara Vithis not having seventeen Citta Khanas taking past Rupas as object.</p>
      <p>If you turn towards the Ruwanweli Mahaseya which is not visible to the eye from home and worship it, what is
        subjected to that worship is not the Ruwanweli Mahaseya you saw earlier, but the Ruwanweli Seya existing there
        at that time. As worshipping it, what arises in you is some Vithi from the five Saptarasayushka Vibhutarammana
        Vithis and two Avibhutarammana Vithis taking the present Rupa as object. It is said that what is subjected to
        that worship is not the Ruwanweli Seya seen earlier, because all Rupas seen earlier by the eye as Ruwanweli Seya
        have ceased.</p>
      <p>In worshipping Ruwanweli Mahaseya from home, the group of Rupa Kalapas which you consider as Ruwanweli Seya,
        having passed one Citta Khana after arising, can also be directed to your Manodvara. The Rupa Kalapas of
        Ruwanweli Mahaseya having passed two, three, four, five Citta Khanas can also come to your Manodvara. From them,
        the first, second, third, fourth, fifth Vibhutarammana Vithis arise in you. If Rupas having passed six or seven
        Citta Khanas are directed to the Manodvara, then Avibhutarammana Vithis arise.</p>
      <p>If the Pannatti called Ruwanweli Mahaseya is directed to the Manodvara, then the Manodvara Vithi taking the
        Pannatti not having seventeen Citta Khanas as object arises.</p>
      <p>If you remember that you saw Ruwanweli Seya, then what arose in you is a Manodvara Vithi taking Cakkhuvinnana
        or Cakkhudvara Vithi as object. That is a Manodvara Vithi arising taking Cittas as object. Remembering Ruwanweli
        Seya is one thing. Remembering that Ruwanweli Seya was seen is another thing. Understand the difference between
        those two without getting confused.</p>
      <p>By seeing Ruwanweli Seya, sometimes great Piti (joy) might have arisen in you. Piti is a Cetasika. If you
        remember the Piti arisen by seeing Ruwanweli Seya, then a Manodvara Vithi taking Piti Cetasika as object arises.
      </p>
      <p>Vedana is also a Cetasika. If you remember a Vedana arisen in you, then a Manodvara Vithi taking Vedana
        Cetasika as object arises. If you feel the Vedana of another person suffering from pain when you see him, then
        what arose is also a Manodvara Vithi taking Vedana Cetasika as object.</p>
      <p>When remembering Adara (love), Kopa (anger), Mana (pride), Irshya (jealousy), Maitri (loving-kindness), Karuna
        (compassion) etc. arising in your continuity, and when feeling those things arising in others, Manodvara Vithi
        taking Cetasikas as object arises.</p>
      <p>Only a few facts that can be easily understood were mentioned here. Thinking according to the mentioned facts,
        understand how Manodvara Vithis arise taking Rupa and Citta - Cetasikas as object.</p>
