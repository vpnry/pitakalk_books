      <p>Friendliness - non-opposition to others - agreeableness - wishing for the welfare of others is Metta.
        Repeatedly maintaining the mind associated with Metta is Metta meditation. There are two methods of practicing
        Metta meditation: practicing Metta meditation to obtain Jhana, and practicing Metta generally to obtain the
        merit of meditation. The meritorious person who is going to practice Metta meditation in whatever way should
        first reflect on the danger of Vyapada or Dosa and the benefit of patience.</p>
      <p>The dangers of Dosa are many. Dosa is a dhamma that burns the mind. It destroys joy. It destroys gentleness and
        creates a terrifying face. It defiles virtue. It distracts the mind. It destroys wisdom. It obstructs practice.
        It is a path to hell. It creates many sins. It destroys the path of Dhamma. It destroys virtues. It is an
        obstruction to the path to heaven and the path to Moksha. It creates various disasters and various dangers. It
        is a fear arising from within oneself. It is an evil. Maintaining Dosa is like swallowing burning charcoal. It
        is like licking the edge of a razor. It is like embracing a serpent.</p>
      <p>Patience is a root for all virtues. It is a fertile ground where virtues grow. It is cool water that
        extinguishes the fire of anger. It is a noble requisite for enlightenment. It is a mother to wholesome dhammas.
        It dispels all suffering. It brings all happiness. It calms the mind. It accomplishes both one's own welfare and
        others' welfare. Thus, the faults of Dosa and the virtues of patience should be considered.</p>
      <p>The easy method to obtain Jhana is to select one suitable person to practice Metta towards and practice Metta
        towards that person only. When selecting a person, one should not take a disliked person, or a very dear person,
        or a neutral person, or an enemy, or a person of the opposite sex, or a dead person. Because of being very dear,
        one should not take a mother, a father, or a sibling. To practice Metta, one should select a teacher or someone
        like a teacher or another virtuous person towards whom one can gladden one's mind. There are many words suitable
        for usage to practice Metta. However, it is better to use a single phrase when developing concentration.</p>
      <p>First, one should practice Metta towards oneself. No matter how long one practices Metta towards oneself, one
        cannot obtain Jhana from it. The benefit of practicing Metta towards oneself is being able to consider that
        others also desire happiness just like oneself. After practicing Metta towards oneself, considering that others
        also desire happiness just like oneself, considering that others also need happiness just like oneself,
        considering the virtuous person one selected to practice Metta as present in front of oneself, establishing
        one's mind at the root of the nose between the eyebrows of that person, repeatedly practice Metta saying "May
        this virtuous person be happy". By doing so, one can obtain Metta Jhana taking that person as the object. The
        yogi who is not satisfied with practicing Metta towards only one person should practice Metta towards oneself,
        towards those unfriendly to oneself, towards those friendly to oneself, and towards neutral persons, and bring
        one's mind to equality towards all those four groups. After that, one can generate the extensive Metta Jhana
        taking many beings as the object.</p>
      <p>Generally, for those who practice Metta meditation, it is good to practice Metta in various ways using various
        words. One should practice Metta towards oneself and towards enemies, friends, and neutral persons using various
        words. When doing so, one should practice Metta sincerely with the intention of making others happy. Some think
        and say "May they be happy" without truly having the desire to make others happy. That is not sincere practice
        of Metta. There is no power in such practices of Metta.</p>
      <p>One should practice Metta towards oneself saying "May I be free from enmity! May I be free from ill-will! May I
        be free from suffering! May I live happily!".</p>
      <p>When practicing Metta towards other beings, one should practice Metta by dividing beings in various ways such
        as by direction, by birth, by plane of existence.</p>
      <p>One should practice Metta with all these phrases or with a few of these phrases: "May all beings living in the
        East be free from enmity! May they be free from ill-will! May they be free from suffering! May they live
        happily! May no one despise another! May no one do evil to another! May all desire each other's welfare! May
        they be endowed with virtues such as faith and morality! May they not commit any sin! May they engage in merits
        such as giving and morality and realize Nibbana!" One should practice Metta towards beings in other directions
        in the same way. May you practice Metta by applying as desired according to planes, births, and regions!!</p>
