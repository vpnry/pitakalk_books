      <p><b>Lesson 17</b></p>
      <p>Persons who have practiced Vipassana meditation and generated Supramundane Path and Fruit are Aryan persons.
        Others are worldlings (Puthujjana).</p>
      <p>There are eight Aryan persons: Sotapatti Maggattha person, Sotapatti Phalattha person, Sakadagami Maggattha
        person, Sakadagami Phalattha person, Anagami Maggattha person, Anagami Phalattha person, Arahatta Maggattha
        person, and Arahatta Phalattha person. There are four Maggattha persons. There are four Phalattha persons. A
        person exists as a Maggattha person only at the moment when the Supramundane Path Consciousness exists in his
        continuity. That is a very short time. Therefore, a Maggattha person cannot be found. With the cessation of the
        Path Consciousness, the Fruit Consciousness arises, so the Maggattha person becomes a Phalattha person. Since
        the Maggattha person stage is momentary, the names Sotapanna person, Sakadagami person, Anagami person, and
        Arahant person are mostly used for Phalattha persons.</p>
      <p><b>Abandoning of Defilements</b></p>
      <p>The two defilements, Ditthi (View) and Vicikiccha (Doubt), are completely abandoned by the <b>Sotapatti
          Magga</b>. Other defilements that are gross enough to cause rebirth in Apaya are also abandoned.</p>
      <p>In terms of consciousness, it is as follows:- The four Ditthi-sampayutta consciousnesses and the
        Vicikiccha-sahagata consciousness, these five consciousnesses are abandoned without remainder by the Sotapatti
        Magga. The four Ditthi-vippayutta consciousnesses and the two Dosa-mula consciousnesses that arise grossly
        enough to cause birth in Apaya are also abandoned.</p>
      <p>The four Ditthi-vippayutta consciousnesses, the two Dosa-mula consciousnesses, and the Uddhacca-sahagata
        consciousness which are not gross enough to cause birth in Apaya remain for the Sotapanna person.</p>
      <p>Gross Lobha, Dosa, and Moha are abandoned by the <b>Sakadagami Magga</b>. Those defilements arise rarely for
        the Sakadagami person. Even when they arise rarely, they do not arise in a gross manner.</p>
      <p>In terms of consciousness, it is as follows:- The gross four Ditthi-vippayutta consciousnesses and the two
        Dosa-mula consciousnesses are abandoned by the Sakadagami Magga. The subtle four Ditthi-vippayutta
        consciousnesses, the two Dosa-mula consciousnesses, and the Uddhacca-sahagata consciousness remain for the
        Sakadagami person.</p>
      <p>Kamaraga and Vyapada are completely abandoned by the <b>Anagami Magga</b>. In terms of consciousness, it is as
        follows:- The four Ditthi-vippayutta consciousnesses with Kamaraga and the two Dosa-mula consciousnesses are
        abandoned without remainder by the Anagami Magga.</p>
      <p>The four Ditthi-vippayutta consciousnesses with Ruparaga - Aruparaga and the Uddhacca-sahagata consciousness
        remain for the Anagami person.</p>
      <p>Ruparaga, Aruparaga, Mana, Uddhacca, and Avijja are abandoned without remainder by the <b>Arahatta Magga</b>.
      </p>
      <p>In terms of consciousness, it is as follows:- The four subtle Ditthi-vippayutta consciousnesses with Ruparaga -
        Aruparaga - Mana and the Uddhacca-sahagata consciousness are abandoned by the Arahatta Magga. There are no
        remaining defilements for the Arahant person.</p>
      <p><b>Attainments (Samapatti)</b></p>
      <p>There are three types of attainments: "Jhana Samapatti, Phala Samapatti, Nirodha Samapatti".</p>
      <p>Dwelling with a certain Rupavacara or Arupavacara Jhana consciousness is called "Jhana Samapatti". For the
        person meditating for that purpose at the stage of attaining Jhana for the first time, after Kamavacara Javana
        consciousnesses arise and cease three or four times under the names Parikamma - Upacara - Anuloma - Gotrabhu,
        the Jhana consciousness arises once and becomes Bhavanga. The person who generates Jhana for the first time is
        called "Adikammika". If the person who has thus attained Jhana once meditates again to generate that Jhana
        consciousness, after Kamavacara Javana arises and ceases three or four times as before, the Jhana consciousness
        arises for many turns. According to the development of the yogi's concentration, the Jhana consciousness itself
        arises continuously for thousands and hundreds of thousands of times without becoming Bhavanga. He can dwell
        like that even for hours. That is <b>Jhana Samapatti</b>.</p>
      <p>Dwelling with Supramundane Fruit Consciousness is <b>Phala Samapatti</b>. If a person who has attained a
        Supramundane Fruit once meditates again to generate it, for him too, Phala consciousnesses arise continuously
        for thousands and hundreds of thousands of times without becoming Bhavanga, just like Jhana consciousnesses.</p>
      <p>Dwelling having completely stopped the arising of consciousness is <b>Nirodha Samapatti</b>. Only Anagamis and
        Arahants who have attained the eight attainments can enter Nirodha Samapatti. They enter Nirodha Samapatti
        wishing to experience the bliss of Nirvana in the present life itself. Anagamis and Arahants in the Arupa
        existence also cannot do it.</p>
      <p>When an Anagami or Arahant person with eight attainments wishes to enter Nirodha Samapatti, sitting in a
        secluded place, he first enters the first Jhana, rises from it, and contemplates the formations belonging to
        that first Jhana as impermanent, suffering, and non-self. Then he enters the second Jhana, rises from it, and
        contemplates the formations belonging to it as impermanent etc. Then he enters the third Jhana, rises from it,
        and contemplates the formations belonging to it as impermanent etc. Thus doing up to Akincannayatana Jhana,
        entering Nevasannanasannayatana Jhana, rising from it, performing the four preliminary duties:
        <b>Nanabaddha-avikopana, Sangha-patimanana, Satthu-pakkosana, Addhana-pariccheda</b>, he enters
        Nevasannanasannayatana Jhana. After the Nevasannanasannayatana consciousness arises once or twice, the arising
        of consciousness in that person stops. That is <b>Nirodha Samapatti</b>. After the time determined to dwell in
        Nirodha has passed, if the person who entered it is an Anagami person, the Anagami Phala consciousness arises
        once, and if an Arahant person, the Arahatta Phala consciousness arises once, and then falls into Bhavanga.
        After that, consciousnesses begin to arise as usual.
      </p>
      <p>Of the four preliminary duties, <b>Nanabaddha-avikopana</b> is determining "If there is any requisite not
        connected to my body, may they not be destroyed during the time I am in Nirodha Samapatti". No danger from fire,
        water etc. happens to the body of the person who has entered Nirodha Samapatti or to an object connected to the
        body during the Nirodha Samapatti time. That is the power of the attainment itself. Since requisites not
        connected to the body are not protected so, one should make a determination regarding them.</p>
      <p><b>Sangha-patimanana</b> is determining "If the Sangha needs me for a Vinaya act, may I rise from the
        attainment at that moment!". <b>Satthu-pakkosana</b> is determining "If the Buddha wants to meet me, may I rise
        from the attainment at that very moment!".</p>
      <p><b>Addhana-pariccheda</b> is "considering one's life span". If death is to happen during the Nirodha Samapatti
        time, one has to rise from the attainment. Therefore, one should look at the time life lasts.</p>
