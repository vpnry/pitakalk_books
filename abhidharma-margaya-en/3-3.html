      </div>
      <p><b>Vitakka, Vicara, Adhimokkha, Viriya, Piti, and Chanda</b> are the six Pakinnaka Cetasikas.</p>
      <p><b>Vitakka</b></p>
      <p>The nature of going towards the object, mounting onto the object is called Vitakka. When Vitakka arrives at the
        object, the Citta and Cetasikas arising with it also arrive at the object following it. Therefore, Vitakka is
        also called the phenomenon that brings Citta and Cetasikas to the object. Weak Vitakka is obscure. It becomes
        apparent when generating Vitakka with intention. Thinking is what is called doing so. The effort made to make
        the mind arrive at places it has not arrived at, to know things not known, is called "thinking".</p>
      <p><b>Vicara</b></p>
      <p>The nature of rubbing the object arrived at by Vitakka is called Vicara. The rubbing intended here is the
        nature of friction on the object, spreading on the object. The Citta that arrived at the object by the power of
        Vitakka spreads on it by the power of Vicara. It acts like pressing and looking. Of Vitakka and Vicara, Vitakka
        is gross. Vicara is subtle. It is obscure. It is said that the gross Vitakka should be known like the first
        striking of a bell, and the subtle Vicara like the subtle sound spreading after the first generated bell sound.
        By this simile, it may be felt that Vicara arises after Vitakka. Although this simile is stated to show the
        nature of the two Cetasikas, they should be understood as two phenomena arising in the same moment without being
        before or after.</p>
      <p><b>Adhimokkha</b></p>
      <p>The nature of deciding the state of the object is called Adhimokkha. Because of this Cetasika, the Citta can
        take the object in a certain one way, whether correctly or incorrectly, without going to two or three sides
        saying "is it like this or like that". If this Cetasika is absent, the Citta is unable to grasp the object
        properly. This is also an obscure Cetasika difficult to understand.</p>
      <p><b>Viriya</b></p>
      <p>The nature of not retreating in the task, the nature of going forward until the started thing is done is called
        Viriya. There are two Viriyas: bodily Viriya and mental Viriya. Here, mental Viriya is intended. Physical
        strength is called bodily Viriya. It is not a mental phenomenon.</p>
      <p><b>Piti</b></p>
      <p>The nature of the mind becoming refreshed - the nature of blooming like a flower, inflating is called Piti.
        This is a very apparent nature.</p>
      <p><b>Chanda</b></p>
      <p>The desire to do various things, the want to do is called Chanda. This is a Cetasika that appears somewhat
        similar to Lobha. However, there is no clinging nature in Chanda as in Lobha. Chanda is a want without clinging.
        There are various types of Chanda. The Chanda arising in Lobha-sahagata Cittas is favorable to Lobha. The Chanda
        arising in Cittas opposed to Lobha is opposed to Lobha.</p>
      <p>These six Cetasikas are called Pakinnaka (Particulars) because they do not apply to every Citta like the
        Sabbacittasadharana Cetasikas, but apply being scattered suitably in Cittas belonging to all sides such as
        Kusala, Akusala, Mundane, Supramundane etc.</p>
      <p>The thirteen Cetasikas, namely the seven Sabbacittasadharana Cetasikas and the six Pakinnaka Cetasikas, are
        called <b>Annasamana</b> because they apply with Cetasikas belonging to the two groups Akusala group and Sobhana
        group.</p>
