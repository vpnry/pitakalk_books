      <p><b>Lesson 18</b></p>
      <p>Vithis in which Mahaggata and Supramundane Javanas occur are called "Appana Vithi". There are five types of
        Appana Vithis: Jhana Vithi, Magga Vithi, Phala Samapatti Vithi, Abhinna Vithi, and Nirodha Samapatti Vithi.</p>
      <p>There are nine Jhana Vithis: First Jhana Vithi, Second Jhana Vithi, Third Jhana Vithi, Fourth Jhana Vithi,
        Fifth Jhana Vithi, Akasanancayatana Jhana Vithi, Vinnanancayatana Jhana Vithi, Akincannayatana Jhana Vithi, and
        Nevasannanasannayatana Jhana Vithi. Since each of these Vithis has two types as Adikammika Vithi and Samapajjana
        Vithi, there are eighteen Jhana Vithis.</p>
      <p>Jhana, Path, and Fruit can only be attained by persons who have obtained wisdom from birth by receiving a
        Nana-sampayutta rebirth. Persons with little wisdom cannot attain Jhana etc. Wise persons are also of two types:
        "those with sharp wisdom and those with not sharp wisdom". In this Dhamma, those with sharp wisdom are called
        <b>Khippabhinna</b>, and those with not sharp wisdom are called <b>Dandhabhinna</b>.
      </p>
      <p>Since each of the eighteen Jhana Vithis mentioned above becomes two based on Dandhabhinna and Khippabhinna
        persons, there are thirty-six Jhana Vithis. Since each of those Vithis becomes two as Kusala Jhana and Kriya
        Jhana, there are seventy-two Jhana Vithis.</p>
      <p><b>Two First Jhana Adikammika Vithis.</b></p>
      <p>When the yogi engaged in meditation suitable for attaining the First Jhana comes close to attaining Jhana,
        after Bhavanga Calana and Bhavangupaccheda, the Manodvaravajjana consciousness arises and ceases taking the
        meditation object as the object. Then, taking that same object, one of the Nana-sampayutta Kamavacara Javanas
        arises and ceases four times under the names Parikamma - Upacara - Anuloma - Gotrabhu, after which the First
        Jhana consciousness arises once and ceases. Then it becomes Bhavanga. This is the First Jhana Adikammika Vithi
        of the Dandhabhinna person.</p>
      <p>For the Khippabhinna person, after Bhavanga Calana and Bhavangupaccheda, taking the meditation object as the
        object, Manodvaravajjana and Kamavacara Javana arise three times as Upacara - Anuloma - Gotrabhu, after which
        the First Jhana consciousness arises once and becomes Bhavanga. This is the First Jhana Adikammika Vithi of the
        Khippabhinna person.</p>
      <p><b>First Jhana Samapajjana Vithi.</b></p>
      <p>When the yogi who has thus attained the First Jhana wishes to enter the Jhana and engages in that meditation
        again, after Bhavanga Calana - Bhavangupaccheda - Manodvaravajjana - Parikamma - Upacara - Anuloma - Gotrabhu
        consciousnesses arise and cease in order, the First Jhana Javana consciousness arises for many turns and then
        becomes Bhavanga. This is the First Jhana Samapajjana Vithi of the Dandhabhinna person. When this Vithi arises
        for the Khippabhinna person, the "Parikamma consciousness" does not arise. Kamavacara Javana arises only three
        times as Upacara - Anuloma - Gotrabhu. That is the only difference.</p>
      <p><b>Dandhabhinna's First Jhana</b></p>
      <p><b>Adikammika Vithi.</b></p>
      <p>Bhavanga Calana, Bhavangupaccheda, Manodvaravajjana, Parikamma, Upacara, Anuloma, Gotrabhu, First Jhana,
        Bhavanga.</p>
      <p><b>Khippabhinna's Adikammika Vithi.</b></p>
      <p>Bhavanga Calana, Bhavangupaccheda, Manodvaravajjana, Upacara, Anuloma, Gotrabhu, First Jhana, Bhavanga.</p>
      <p>The difference in the two Samapajjana Vithis is only that the Jhana consciousness arises for many turns. The
        order of consciousness in Second Jhana Vithis etc. is also the same. The difference is only the arising of the
        respective Jhana consciousness in the respective Vithi.</p>
      <p>Of the Kamavacara Javanas arising in these Vithis, the first consciousness is given the name <b>Parikamma</b>
        because it exists as if preparing for Appana by specially helping the Appana consciousness to arise through
        factors such as balancing the faculties. The second consciousness is given the name <b>Upacara</b> because it is
        close to Appana by way of helping the Appana consciousness to arise in the near future. The meaning of the word
        Upacara is the consciousness that behaves near. The third consciousness is given the name <b>Anuloma</b> because
        it exists in conformity with Appana by way of removing obstacles to the arising of Appana consciousness such as
        Kamacchanda. The fourth consciousness is given the name <b>Gotrabhu</b> because since it transcends the
        Kamavacara state, only an Appana consciousness and not a Kamavacara consciousness arises next to that
        consciousness.</p>
      <p><b>Paccavekkhana Vithi</b></p>
      <p>After attaining Jhana and after rising from Jhana attainment, Jhana attainers review the Jhana factors in the
        Jhana they attained or entered. They do this to develop Adverting Mastery (Avajjana Vasi) and Reviewing Mastery
        (Paccavekkhana Vasi). Paccavekkhana Vithis arise according to the number of Jhana factors in the respective
        Jhanas. Since there are five Jhana factors in the First Jhana, five Vithis arise as "Vithi reviewing Vitakka,
        Vithi reviewing Vicara, Vithi reviewing Piti, Vithi reviewing Sukha, Vithi reviewing Ekaggata". Only Kamavacara
        Javanas arise in Paccavekkhana Vithis. The Paccavekkhana Vithi becomes Bhavanga after the Manodvaravajjana
        consciousness taking the Jhana factor as the object arises following Bhavanga Calana and Bhavangupaccheda, and a
        certain Kamavacara Javana arises seven times.</p>
      <p>In occasions where those with mastery review Jhana factors quickly for performing miracles etc., the Vithi ends
        with five or four Kamavacara Javanas.</p>
