      <p><b>Part 1</b></p>
      <p>“Arammana” (Object) is called for things that are felt - caught by the mind - grasped by the mind.</p>
      <p>There are six objects according to doors: <b>Rupammana, Saddarammana, Gandharammana, Rasarammana,
          Photthabbarammana, Dhammarammana</b>.</p>
      <p>The color in matters is <b>Rupammana</b>. Only Rupammana is seen by the eye. It is the color that is seen by
        the eye, not the objects. Everything has a color. But the color of very subtle things is not seen by our eyes.
      </p>
      <p>The thing felt by the Sothindriya or ear is called <b>Saddarammana</b>.</p>
      <p>Good and bad smells felt by the nose are called <b>Gandharammana</b>.</p>
      <p>Tastes felt by the tongue are called <b>Rasarammana</b>.</p>
      <p>Hardness - softness - coldness - heat etc. felt by the Kayindriya are called <b>Photthabbarammana</b>.</p>
      <p>All things felt by the mind - caught by the mind excluding the five objects form etc. are called
        <b>Dhammarammana</b>. Dhammarammana is sixfold as Pasada Rupa - Sukhuma Rupa - Citta - Cetasika - Nirvana -
        Pannatti. They will be known in the future. For now, just remember the six parts by name.
      </p>
      <p>There are four parts of objects as Past - Future - Present - Time-freed. The thing that arose and ceased is
        called “Atitarammana”. The thing that will arise in the future is called “Anagatarammana”. The existing thing is
        called “Vattamanarammana”. This division of time is for things that have arising and ceasing. Nirvana and
        Pannatti do not have arising and ceasing. Therefore, they are not included in any of the three times. They are
        called “Kala Vimutta” (Time-freed). (This is a deep fact. Ask teachers and learn more.)</p>
      <p>Only the present Rupammana is the object for the forty-six Cakkhudvarika Cittas. Past and future forms are not
        caught by Cakkhudvarika Cittas. Similarly, present sounds - smells - tastes - touches are objects for Cittas
        belonging to Sota - Ghana - Jivha - Kaya doors.</p>
      <p>For Manodvarika Cittas, the six objects Form - Sound - Smell - Taste - Touch - Dhamma belonging to all three
        times and Nirvana - Pannatti which are Time-freed are objects.</p>
      <p>For Dvaravimutta Cittas, the six objects which are present, past, or Pannatti called Kamma - Kamma Nimitta -
        Gati Nimitta that were objects for the death-proximate Javanas in the immediately preceding past existence are
        objects.</p>
      <p><b>Part II</b></p>
      <p>The objects of Cittas were shown above indefinitely according to doors. The object belonging to each Citta
        definitely should be known as stated below.</p>
      <p>The two Cakkhuvinnanas take only Form as object. Sota - Ghana - Jivha - Kaya Vinnanas take Sound - Smell -
        Taste - Touch as objects.</p>
      <p>The three Cittas Pancadvaravajjana - Sampaticchana called Manodhatu take the five objects Form etc. as objects.
      </p>
      <p>The twelve Cittas: eleven Kamavacara Vipaka Cittas excluding Dvi Panca Vinnana and Manodhatu, and Hasituppada
        take Kamavacara Dhammas as objects. “Kamavacara Dhamma” is called for the fifty-four Kama Cittas, the Cetasikas
        associated with them, and the twenty-eight Rupas.</p>
      <p>The twelve Akusala Cittas and the eight Nana Vippayutta Kamavacara Javana Cittas take all objects except the
        nine Lokuttara Dhammas. “Nine Lokuttara Dhammas” is called for the eight Lokuttara Cittas and Nirvana.</p>
      <p>The five Cittas: four Nana Sampayutta Kamavacara Kusala Cittas and the Rupavacara Fifth Jhana Kusala Citta
        which has reached Abhinna state take all objects except Arahat Magga and Arahat Phala.</p>
      <p>The six Cittas: four Nana Sampayutta Maha Kriya Cittas, Rupavacara Fifth Jhana Kriya Citta which has reached
        Abhinna state, and Manodvaravajjana take all objects.</p>
      <p>“Sarvajnatajnana” (Omniscience) is called for the wisdom in the Maha Kriya Nana Sampayutta Cittas arising in
        Lord Buddhas. Just by attaining Jhana, one cannot perform Iddhi Pratiharya (Psychic Miracles). The power of
        Iddhi Pratiharya is only in the two Rupavacara Kusala Kriya Fifth Jhana Cittas. Even the ordinary Fifth Jhana
        Citta does not have that power. To get that power, the Fifth Jhana Citta must be further developed. The Fifth
        Jhana Citta thus developed is called “<b>Abhinna Citta</b>”. Whoever performs Iddhi Pratiharya, everyone does it
        with Abhinna Citta. Lokuttara Cittas do not have the ability to perform Iddhi Pratiharya.</p>
      <p>Among Arupavacara Cittas, Akasanancayatana Citta is taken as object by the three Vinnanancayatana Cittas, and
        Akincannayatana Citta is taken as object by the three Nevasanna Nasannayatana Cittas. Since Akasanancayatana
        Vinnanancayatana Cittas are Mahaggata, the six Vinnanancayatana Nevasanna Nasannayatana Cittas taking them as
        objects are called “<b>Mahaggatarammanika Cittas</b>”.</p>
      <p>The twenty-one Cittas: fifteen Rupavacara Cittas, three Akasanancayatana Cittas, and three Akincannayatana
        Cittas take Pannatti such as Kasina as objects.</p>
      <p>Nirvana is taken as object by Lokuttara Cittas.</p>
      <p>There are twenty-five Cittas taking Kamavacara Dhammas as objects. There are six Cittas taking Mahaggata
        Dhammas as objects. There are twenty-one Cittas taking Pannatti as objects. There are eight Cittas taking
        Nirvana as objects. There are twenty Cittas taking all objects except Lokuttara Dhammas. There are five Cittas
        taking all objects except Arahat Magga and Phala. There are six Cittas taking all objects.</p>
