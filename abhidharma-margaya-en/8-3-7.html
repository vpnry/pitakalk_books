      <p><b>Sammaditthi, Sammasankappa, Sammavaca, Sammakammanta, Sammaajiva, Sammavayama, Sammasati, Samma Samadhi</b>
        - these eight Dhammas are called Maggangas.</p>
      <p>By these eight Dhammas such as Sammaditthi etc. arising associated with a single Citta at once in Lokuttara
        state, the destruction of Kilesas and the realization of Nibbana are accomplished. Here, by 'Magga' (Path), the
        meaning of "means" (Upaya) is expressed. It is the means for the destruction of Kilesas and the realization of
        Nibbana. By 'Anga' (Factor), the meaning of "limb" or "part" is expressed. The parts of the means for destroying
        Kilesas and realizing Nibbana are called Maggangas. There are four states in this Lokuttara Magga. Those states
        are respectively called Sotapatti Magga, Sakadagami Magga, Anagami Magga, Arahatta Magga. The eight Maggangas
        should be understood as stated in the Missaka Sangaha.</p>
      <p>These Bodhipakkhiya Dhammas which are thirty-seven by classification, become fourteen as Paramattha Dhammas
        namely Smrti, Viriya, Chanda, Citta, Panna, Saddha, Ekaggata, Piti, Passaddhi, Tatramajjhattata, Vitakka, Samma
        Vaca, Samma Kammanta, Samma Ajiva.</p>
      <p>Among these fourteen Dhammas, the nine Dhammas Vitakka, Passaddhi, Piti, Tatramajjhattata, Chanda, Citta, and
        the three Viratis appear in only one place each. Viriya which is one Dhamma appears in nine places as four
        Sammappadhanas, Viriyiddhipada, Viriyindriya, Viriyabala, Viriya Sambojjhanga, Sammavayama. Sati which is one
        Dhamma appears in eight places as four Satipatthanas, Satindriya, Satibala, Sati Sambojjhanga, Sammasati.
        Ekaggata appears in four places as Samadhindriya, Samadhibala, Samadhi Sambojjhanga, Samma Samadhi. Panna
        Cetasika appears in five places as Vimansiddhipada, Pannindriya, Pannabala, Dhammavicaya Sambojjhanga,
        Sammaditthi. Saddha Cetasika appears in two places as Saddhindriya, Saddhabala.</p>
      <p>All these Bodhipakkhiya Dhammas are generally found in all Lokuttara Cittas. In Lokuttara Cittas such as Dutiya
        Jhana, Samma Sankappa is not found, and in Lokuttara Cittas of Catuttha Jhana and Pancama Jhana, both Samma
        Sankappa and Piti Sambojjhanga are not found. When fulfilling Vishuddhis with the expectation of reaching the
        Lokuttara Magga, Bodhipakkhiya Dhammas are found in Lokiya Cittas as appropriate. All Bodhipakkhiya Dhammas are
        not found at once in Lokiya Cittas as in Lokuttara Citta.</p>
