      <p>The seven Akusala Kamma Pathas (Courses of Unwholesome Action) namely Adattadana (Stealing), Kamesumicchacara
        (Sexual Misconduct), Musavada (Lying), Pisunavaca (Slandering), Samphappalapa (Frivolous Talk), Abhijja
        (Covetousness), and Micchaditthi (Wrong View) are committed by Lobhamula Cittas.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, in drinking intoxicants, gambling, taking bribes, giving bribes, dancing and watching dances for
        enjoyment, playing and listening to lute etc., singing and listening to songs, applying perfumes for pleasure,
        wearing beautiful clothes and ornaments, eating delicious food for pleasure, drinking delicious drinks, looking
        at beautiful things for enjoyment, playing games, watching games, doing various things to earn wealth, obtaining
        wealth, protecting obtained wealth, giving wealth to obtain loved objects, preparing loved objects like clothes,
        houses, vehicles etc., and using them; in these instances, mostly Lobhamula Cittas arise.</p>
      <p>When young men and women see each other, talk to each other, deal with each other; when husbands and wives see
        each other, speak affectionately; when providing beautiful clothes and ornaments to wives and children; mostly
        Lobhamula Cittas arise. In going on pleasure trips also, mostly Lobhamula Cittas arise. In nourishing children,
        fondling them, giving them in marriage, mostly Lobhamula Cittas arise. It must be said that for ordinary people
        living away from Dhamma, the majority of Cittas arising throughout the day until they go to sleep are Lobhamula
        Cittas.</p>
      <p>For those who engage in earning wealth etc. keeping Saddha (Faith), Metta (Loving-kindness), and Karuna
        (Compassion) in the forefront, Akusala Cittas do not arise in those activities. For one who engages in earning
        wealth, protecting wealth, spending, providing clothes, food and drinks, wearing, eating and drinking with
        wisdom in the forefront, considering utility etc., Akusala Cittas do not arise.</p>
      <p>Lobhamula Cittas arise in one who prepares food and one who eats with the expectation of taste or with the
        expectation of beautifying the body etc.</p>
      <p>Akusala Cittas do not arise in one who prepares food expecting to appease hunger and maintain life.</p>
      <p>Lobhamula Cittas arise in preparing clothes and wearing them with the expectation of becoming beautiful, with
        the expectation of winning others' hearts, or with the expectation of appearing as a high-class person.</p>
      <p>Akusala Cittas do not arise in the person who prepares and wears clothes with the hope of covering parts that
        are disgusting to see, with the hope of dispelling cold, dispelling heat, and protecting from flies and
        mosquitoes.</p>
      <p>Akusala Cittas do not arise in preparing or wearing a beautiful garment or a valuable garment with the
        expectation of escaping the contempt of onlookers due to the garment not being beautiful.</p>
      <p>Lobhamula Cittas arise when giving food to animals and small children to enjoy watching them eat. When giving
        food to animals as a favor (kindness), Kusala Cittas arise.</p>
      <p>Lobhamula Cittas arise when catching animals upon seeing them as beautiful, and when raising them to look at
        their beauty.</p>
