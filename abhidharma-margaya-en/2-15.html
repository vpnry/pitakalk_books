      <p>The Fifth Jhana Citta, which is made more peaceful and superior by removing forms, is called "Arupavacara
        Citta". It is also divided into three as Kusala, Vipaka, and Kriya, just like the Rupavacara Citta.</p>
      <p><b>The Four Arupavacara Kusala Cittas</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Akasanancayatana Kusala Citta</b></li>
        <li><b>Vinnancayatana Kusala Citta</b></li>
        <li><b>Akincannayatana Kusala Citta</b></li>
        <li><b>Nevasannanasannayatana Kusala Citta</b></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Thus, there are four Arupavacara Kusala Cittas based on the difference of objects. This Arupavacara Citta is
        the only Citta that becomes differentiated due to objects. Arupavacara Cittas can only be developed by those who
        have attained the Rupavacara Fifth Jhana. Some of those who have attained the Rupavacara Fifth Jhana, seeing the
        trouble of maintaining the physical body (Rupa-Kaya), and seeing that many sufferings arise for beings because
        of the physical body, become disenchanted with the physical body and develop Arupa Jhanas with the expectation
        of obtaining a formless existence.</p>
      <p>Arupa Jhanas are developed as follows: The attainer of the Rupavacara Fifth Jhana sits for a while with the
        Fifth Jhana Citta taking a Kasina other than the Space Kasina as the object. Then, with the expectation of
        removing his Jhana Citta from the form sign (Rupa Nimitta), he looks at the Kasina sign which was the object of
        the Jhana Citta with his mind, and starts to think or meditate on it as "Space" without thinking of it as a
        form. When meditating like that, the form Kasina sign disappears, and space appears in the place where the
        Kasina sign was seen earlier. Since it is taken from the Kasina, that visible space is called "Kasugghatimakasa"
        (Space obtained by removing the Kasina). When meditating further as "Space - Space", the Rupavacara Fifth Jhana
        which previously existed on a form sign arises again taking that space as the object. Developing it in this way
        is the removal of the Rupavacara Fifth Jhana from the form sign. That Fifth Jhana Citta, which is removed from
        the form sign, is the First Arupavacara Citta.</p>
      <p>The space that becomes the object of that Citta is something that is felt only by the meditator's mind, not
        something that actually exists. It is a concept (Pannatti). That space, which does not exist in reality, has no
        beginning point of arising first. It has no end point of ceasing. Therefore, it is called Infinite Space
        (Anantakasa). Since it is associated with the Jhana that takes Infinite Space as the object, the First
        Arupavacara Kusala Citta is given the name "Akasanancayatana Kusala Citta".</p>
      <p><b>The meaning of Akasanancayatana Kusala Citta is the Kusala Citta existing with Infinite Space as the
          object.</b></p>
      <p>The meditator who has attained the Akasanancayatana Jhana, in order to further remove his Jhana from the form
        sign, abandons the space which is the object of the First Arupavacara Citta, takes only that Citta, and starts
        meditating on it as "Consciousness, Consciousness" (Vinnana, Vinnana). When doing so, the Vinnancayatana Kusala
        Citta arises in him, taking the First Arupa Citta as the object.</p>
      <p><b>The meaning of Vinnancayatana Kusala Citta is the Citta associated with Jhana existing with Consciousness as
          the object.</b></p>
      <p>Even for those who have attained Jhana, the Jhana Citta is not always present. When dwelling with another
        Citta, the Jhana Citta is not there. The meditator who has attained the Second Arupa Jhana, in order to attain
        the Third Arupa Jhana, meditates as "Natthi Kinci - Natthi Kinci" (There is nothing - There is nothing) by
        reflecting on the absence of the First Arupa Jhana Citta. When doing so, the Akincannayatana Kusala Citta, which
        is the Third Arupa Jhana Citta, arises taking the absence of the First Arupavacara Citta as the object.</p>
      <p><b>The meaning of Akincannayatana Kusala Citta is the Citta associated with Jhana taking the absence of the
          First Arupavacara Citta as the object.</b></p>
      <p>The meditator who has attained the Third Arupa Jhana, in order to attain the Fourth Arupa Jhana, takes the
        Third Arupa Jhana Citta he has attained and starts meditating as "This is peaceful - This is superior". From
        that meditation, the Fourth Arupa Jhana Citta arises taking the Third Arupa Jhana Citta as the object. It is the
        Citta that is at the peak of subtlety. There is no other Citta more subtle than that. Its subtlety is such that
        it is difficult to know whether the meditator dwelling with that Citta "lived with a mind or lived without a
        mind". Since it is very subtle, that Fourth Arupa Jhana Citta is called "Nevasannanasannayatana Kusala Citta".
      </p>
      <p>The meaning of Nevasannanasannayatana Kusala Citta is the Kusala Citta which is so subtle that it is neither
        with perception nor without perception.</p>
