      <p>The person learning Citta Vithi should first know the lifespan of Cittas and Rupas. There are three stages for
        Cittas and Rupas called arising time, existing time, and perishing time. Since they are very short, the name
        <b>Khana</b> (Moment) is used for those times. The arising time is called <b>Uppada Khana</b>, the existing time
        is called <b>Thiti Khana</b>, and the perishing time is called <b>Bhanga Khana</b>. The three times Uppada -
        Thiti - Bhanga belonging to a Citta are collectively called a Citta Khana. The meaning of Citta Khana is the
        time of a Citta. If a Citta arises in a certain amount of time, it exists for the same amount of time, and
        ceases in the same amount of time. There is no difference in the duration of those three times. That Citta Khana
        is a very short time. It is a time not even equal to a hundred-thousandth part of the time taken to blink an
        eye. It may take some time for you to understand this.
      </p>
      <p>A Rupa has a lifespan of seventeen Citta Khanas. That is fifty-one small Khanas. Therein, the first Khana is
        the Uppada Khana of the Rupa. The fifty-first Khana is the Bhanga Khana of the Rupa. The middle forty-nine
        Khanas are the Thiti Khana of the Rupa. The three Khanas Uppada etc. of the Rupa are not equal like in the
        Citta. The Thiti Khana of the Rupa is long. There are also several Rupas which do not have a lifespan of
        seventeen Citta Khanas. They are minor Rupas.</p>
      <p>To you who see that objects exist before us for months - years, the statement “The lifespan of a Rupa is
        seventeen Citta Khanas” might be an unacceptable fact. A description about Rupa is given for it to be
        understood.</p>
      <p>A pile of sand seen as one thing when looking from afar is not one thing, but a collection of sand grains. All
        objects seen by us as single things are collections of small objects just like the pile of sand. Even a mustard
        seed considered as a very small thing is not one thing but a collection of small substances. All objects seen by
        us are made of Rupa Kalapas. You will be able to know about Rupa Kalapa in the Rupa Chapter. Rupa Kalapa is the
        root of all objects. It is not something that exists for a long time. Its maximum lifespan is seventeen Citta
        Khanas. The time taken to blink an eye is sufficient for thousands of Rupa Kalapas to arise and perish one after
        another. In an object of the size of a mustard seed, there are crores of Rupa Kalapas. It should be known that a
        mustard seed is not one thing, but a collection of crores of Rupa Kalapas. Although the Rupa Kalapas in the
        objects seen by us perish in seventeen Citta Khanas, no difference is seen in those objects due to two reasons.
        That is: One reason is that all Rupa Kalapas in one object do not break at once. One reason is that new Rupa
        Kalapas appear in those respective places replacing the broken Rupa Kalapas.</p>
      <p>In an object of the size of a mustard seed also, there are lakhs of Rupa Kalapas which have reached the second
        Khana out of the fifty-one small Khanas which is the complete lifespan of a Rupa. Similarly, there are lakhs of
        Rupa Kalapas which have reached the third Khana. Similarly, there are lakhs of Rupa Kalapas which have reached
        all Khanas up to the fiftieth Khana. Every Rupa Kalapa breaks at the fifty-first Khana. When Rupas break
        reaching the fifty-first Khana, all Rupa Kalapas which have reached the Khanas from the second Khana to the
        forty-ninth Khana remain. Therefore, due to Rupas breaking every seventeen Citta Khanas, no visible change
        occurs in the objects. This matter should be understood well.</p>
      <p>Citta Vithis do not arise at once regarding all Rupas of various ages in one object. Citta Vithis arise taking
        as object a group of Rupas of equal age in one object.</p>
