      <p>Pure virtue is Sila Visuddhi. A person who is immoral cannot obtain Jhanas or supramundane paths and fruits.
        Immorality is an obstruction to Jhanas etc. Therefore, a person who enters meditation with the hope of reaching
        a high state should purify his virtue and start meditation being established in pure virtue.</p>
      <p>Sila Visuddhi should be stated separately for laypeople and monks. For laypeople, being established in any
        precept among the five precepts etc. belonging to laypeople is the Sila Visuddhi of the layperson. Patimokkha
        Samvara Sila, Indriya Samvara Sila, Ajiva Parisuddhi Sila, and Paccayasannissita Sila, which are the
        Catuparisuddhi Sila, are the Sila Visuddhi of monks.</p>
      <p>The group of precepts laid down by the Buddha for monks is <b>Patimokkha Samvara Sila</b>. It is the main
        virtue among mundane virtues.</p>
      <p>For those who take signs of objects such as forms encountered by doors such as the eye, thinking they are good,
        wanting to obtain them, or thinking they are bad, many defilements such as greed and hatred arise. To prevent
        defilements from arising due to forms etc., one should live constantly with mindfulness. That mindfulness which
        prevents the arising of defilements is <b>Indriya Samvara Sila</b>.</p>
      <p>Abstaining from improper actions done for livelihood is <b>Ajiva Parisuddhi Sila</b>. This should also be
        stated separately for laypeople and monks. For laypeople, abstaining from wrong livelihoods such as killing and
        the five wrong trades for living, and living righteously is the Ajiva Parisuddhi Sila of the layperson. The
        layperson's Ajiva Parisuddhi is included in the five precepts etc. For monks, abstaining from obtaining
        requisites by pleasing laypeople through hypocrisy and giving things etc., and living by obtaining the four
        requisites righteously through alms rounds etc. is the Ajiva Parisuddhi Sila of monks.</p>
      <p>The reflection knowledge that prevents the arising of delusion, craving, and intoxication that may arise when
        accepting and using even righteously obtained requisites is <b>Paccayasannissita Sila</b>. To protect that
        virtue, one should reflect on the benefits of food and drinks etc. One should reflect on food and drinks etc. as
        repulsive or as elements. Not doing so is not an obstacle for laypeople to obtain paths and fruits.</p>
