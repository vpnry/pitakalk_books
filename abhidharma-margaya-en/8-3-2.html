        <li>Effort made for the abandoning of arisen Akusalas,</li>
        <li>Effort made for the non-arising of unarisen Akusalas,</li>
        <li>Effort made for the arising of unarisen Kusalas,</li>
        <li>Effort made for the development of arisen Kusalas,</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Thus there are four Sammappadhanas.</p>
      <p>The strong Viriya maintained with the determination "Even if the blood in the body dries up and the flesh
        withers away leaving only bones, skin and sinews due to much exertion, I will not stop this effort made to reach
        the Lokuttara Magga" is called Sammappadhana. Although that Viriya is one as a Dhamma, it has been preached as
        four Sammappadhanas according to the functions performed by it.</p>
      <p>If any sinful action has been committed by oneself, the strong Viriya maintained in observing Sila and engaging
        in Samatha Vipassana Bhavana so that such a sin will not be committed by oneself again until reaching Nibbana is
        the first Sammappadhana. </p>
      <p>The Viriya maintained in observing Sila and engaging in Samatha Vipassana Bhavana so that sinful actions which
        are not known to have been committed by oneself, but known by seeing or hearing others doing them or from Dhamma
        books, will never arise in one's continuum, so that those sinful actions will not be done by oneself, is the
        second Sammappadhana.</p>
      <p>The effort made to generate Kusala Dhammas such as Sila, Samatha Vipassana Bhavana Kusalas which have not yet
        arisen in one's continuum, or in other words, the Viriya maintained to attain the Vishuddhis not yet attained
        among the Seven Vishuddhis is the third Sammappadhana. </p>
      <p>Even if a Puthujjana person has developed some virtue like Sila, those virtues can decline by succumbing to
        Kilesas or by going to another existence. The effort made to reach the Lokuttara Magga and make those virtues
        firm so that it does not happen is the fourth Sammappadhana. </p>
