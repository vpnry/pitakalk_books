        <h2>2. Four Great Essentials</h2><i class="material-icons share-icon" file-name="7-2.html">share</i>
      </div>
      <p>There are four Great Essentials: Pathavi Dhatu, Apo Dhatu, Tejo Dhatu, and Vayo Dhatu. They are called Maha
        Bhuta (Great Essentials) because they manifest as great things like the great earth, mountains, seas, rivers,
        etc.</p>
      <p><b>Pathavi Dhatu</b></p>
      <p>The hardness felt when touching or pressing any object is Pathavi Dhatu. When touching or pressing some
        objects, softness is felt. That softness is also not something else but a lesser degree of hardness. The words
        'hard' and 'soft' are names given to one thing relative to another, just like the words 'small' and 'big'. What
        is called 'small' becomes 'big' when compared to something smaller than it. Similarly, what is called 'big'
        becomes 'small' when compared to something bigger than it. Thus, what is called 'soft' becomes 'hard' when
        compared to something softer than it. What is called 'hard' becomes 'soft' when compared to something harder
        than it. Since facts are such, it should be understood that both hardness and softness refer to the same Pathavi
        Dhatu. What is felt to the hand is the hardness that is not very subtle. The very subtle hardness in some things
        is not even felt to the hand. The meaning of the word 'Dhatu' is the nature that is not a being.</p>
      <p><b>Apo Dhatu</b></p>
      <p>The cohesive nature is Apo Dhatu. The nature of spreading inside and outside of conjoined Rupas is the nature
        of Apo Dhatu. The nature of pulling towards itself the thing it has come into contact with, absorbing, holding
        without letting go away from itself is the nature of Apo Dhatu. Objects in the world exist bound together and
        solidified without scattering like dust due to the power of Apo Dhatu. Objects where Pathavi Dhatu is excessive
        and Apo Dhatu is scarce exist as solid lumps. Bones, nerves, flesh etc. in bodies and earth, stones, iron,
        leaves, bark, roots, wood etc. are things with less Apo Dhatu and more Pathavi Dhatu. If Pathavi Dhatu becomes
        scarce and Apo Dhatu becomes excessive, a liquid thing, a flowing thing is formed. Oil, water etc. are things
        with less Pathavi Dhatu and excessive Apo Dhatu.</p>
      <p><b>Tejo Dhatu</b></p>
      <p>Heat and cold are Tejo Dhatu. Maturing and ripening the conjoined Rupas is the function performed by Tejo
        Dhatu. In the tender stage, due to that maturing, Rupas become mature and strong. They grow. After the
        completion of maturity, due to the repeated maturing, bodies of beings and external objects decay and perish.
        Both improvement and decline of respective objects are caused by the same Tejo Dhatu. Fire has excessive Tejo
        Dhatu.</p>
      <p><b>Vayo Dhatu</b></p>
      <p>The nature of inflating and pushing is Vayo Dhatu. The object where it is excessive exists expanded by
        inflation and less in weight. The thing with very excessive Vayo Dhatu is wind. Since the pushing nature is
        excessive, it moves constantly.</p>
      <p>None of these four elements can arise or exist separated from the other three elements. In iron and stone where
        Pathavi Dhatu is prominent, in fire where Tejo Dhatu is prominent, and in wind where Vayo Dhatu is prominent,
        all four elements are present.</p>
      <p><b>Five Prasada Rupas</b></p>
      <p>There are five Prasada Rupas: Cakkhu Prasada - Sota Prasada - Ghana Prasada - Jivha Prasada - Kaya Prasada.</p>
      <p>The desire to see - desire to hear - desire to smell good scents - desire to taste good flavors - desire to
        feel good touches; these desires exist very strongly in beings. The Kamma that causes birth in existence for the
        being is connected with those desires. Therefore, when the being is born in existence, the Kamma which has
        connections with desires produces the faculties which are instruments to take and enjoy those desired things in
        the body of that being. What are called Prasada Rupas are those faculties which help to take Rupa etc. The
        meaning of the word 'Prasada' is 'sensitive surface'. The names Cakkhu Prasada etc. refer to five distinct
        sensitive surfaces helpful for taking mutually different Rupa - Sabda - Gandha - Rasa - Sprastavya.</p>
      <p><b>Cakkhu Prasada</b></p>
      <p>The sensitive surface located in the eye helpful for seeing forms is Cakkhu Prasada. It is located in the
        middle of the black circle of the eye, in a place about the size of a louse's head, or according to another
        opinion, about the size of a mung bean, spreading like oil on cotton wool in seven subtle layers. When the
        images of objects coming in front of the eye fall on that place, Cakkhu Vinnana Citta arises there. Seeing means
        the arising of that Cakkhu Vinnana. This sensitive surface called Cakkhu Prasada is not a separate thing that
        can be separated, but a sensitivity of the Great Essentials themselves. It is located in the Great Essentials
        themselves. Other Prasadas are also similarly sensitivities of the Great Essentials themselves.</p>
      <p><b>Sota Prasada</b></p>
      <p>The sensitive surface located in the ear helpful for knowing or hearing sound is Sota Prasada. It is located in
        the ear base in a place shaped like a ring with fine copper-colored hairs. When the image of sound strikes
        there, Sota Vinnana arises right there. Hearing means the arising of Sota Vinnana. Since Sota Prasada is a
        different kind of sensitivity, only the sound image is reflected there, not the visual image.</p>
      <p><b>Ghana Prasada</b></p>
      <p>The sensitive surface located in the nose helpful for knowing good and bad smells is Ghana Prasada. It is
        located inside the nose in a place shaped like a goat's hoof. Ghana Vinnana which knows the smell arises there.
      </p>
      <p><b>Jivha Prasada</b></p>
      <p>The sensitive surface located in the tongue helpful for knowing the taste of food and drink etc. is Jivha
        Prasada. It is located on the upper surface of the tongue in a place shaped like the tip of a water lily petal.
        When food and drink etc. touch there, Jivha Vinnana which knows the taste arises there.</p>
      <p><b>Kaya Prasada</b></p>
      <p>The sensitive surface located spreading in the body helpful for knowing tangible objects is Kaya Prasada. It is
        spread throughout the entire body except for the area where digestive fire is located, and hair, body hair,
        nails, and dry skin. Kaya Vinnana which knows the touching of respective things on the body arises in those
        respective touched places associating with that sensitivity. Pain inside the body arises due to the collision of
        things inside the body with each other.</p>
