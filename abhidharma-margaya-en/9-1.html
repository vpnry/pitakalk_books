      <p>The group of ultimate realities (paramartha dharma) consisting of the eighty-nine cittas, fifty-two cetasikas,
        and twenty-eight rupas, which are the fundamental elements forming the multitude of beings such as devas and
        humans and all objects, has been analyzed and shown in various ways in the previous seven chapters. Now, what
        you should investigate is this matter: do those ultimate realities arise spontaneously? Or are they created by
        some powerful being? How do they arise?</p>
      <p>Citta, cetasika, and rupa paramarthas arise from various causes. Therefore, they are called 'conditioned
        phenomena' (sankhata dharma) and also 'formations' (sankhara). The Nirvana paramartha is not something that
        arises from conditions. Therefore, it is called the 'unconditioned element' (asankhata dhatu).</p>
      <p>The causes that produce conditioned phenomena are also called 'conditions' (paccaya). The Buddha has preached
        the causes of the arising of formations in three methods: the method of Noble Truths, the method of Dependent
        Origination (Paticcasamuppada), and the method of Relations (Patthana). Of these, the method of Noble Truths is
        the very brief method. The method of Dependent Origination is the medium method. The method of Relations is the
        detailed method.</p>
      <p>Since the analysis of Noble Truths was stated in the seventh chapter, what remains to be explained in this
        section on conditions are the method of Dependent Origination and the method of Relations.</p>
      <p>The method of Dependent Origination is the cause-and-effect method that teaches how samsara continues unbroken
        by the arising of other dharmas due to the presence of certain dharmas, such as: when ignorance exists,
        formations arise due to ignorance; when formations exist, consciousness arises due to them, and so on. It has
        been preached in the Vibhanga Prakarana of the Abhidharma Pitaka.</p>
      <p>The cause-and-effect method preached in the Patthana Maha Prakarana is the method of Relations. In the teaching
        of Dependent Origination, only the arising of formations etc. due to ignorance etc. is taught; there is no
        teaching that ignorance has these specific powers, and that ignorance becomes a condition for formations or
        produces formations by such and such powers among those powers in such and such ways. However, in the Patthana,
        the conditioning powers existing in all dharmas, both ultimate and non-ultimate, and how those dharmas become
        conditions for other dharmas by various powers such as hetu (root), arammana (object), etc., are taught. A
        complete knowledge of the Buddha's Dhamma is gained by learning both these methods. Of these two methods, the
        shorter method is the method of Dependent Origination. Therefore, the method of Dependent Origination will be
        explained here first. It is useful for the learner to first memorize the Paticcasamuppada teaching Pali.
        Memorize it. It is as follows:-</p>
