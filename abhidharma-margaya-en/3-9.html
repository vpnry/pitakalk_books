      </div>
      <p>Among the Sobhana Cetasikas, the nineteen Sobhana Sadharana Cetasikas associate with all Sobhana Cittas without
        distinction: fifty-nine in the brief method and ninety-one in the detailed method.</p>
      <p>The three Virati Cetasikas always associate together in Lokuttara Cittas. In Lokiya Cittas, they associate
        separately on some occasions in the eight Kamavacara Kusala Cittas. Only one Virati Cetasika associates at a
        time in Kamavacara Kusala.</p>
      <p>The two Appamanna Cetasikas associate separately on some occasions in twenty-eight Cittas: twelve Rupavacara
        Cittas of First, Second, Third, and Fourth Jhanas, eight Kamavacara Kusala, and eight Sahetuka Kamavacara Kriya.
        Karuna and Mudita do not associate together in one Citta at the same time. There is also a teacher's opinion
        that "Karuna and Mudita associate only with Somanassa Sahagata Cittas and not with Upekkha Sahagata Cittas."
        According to that opinion, there are twenty Cittas where Karuna and Mudita associate.</p>
      <p>Panna Cetasika associates with forty-seven Cittas: twelve Nana Sampayutta Kamavacara Cittas, fifteen Rupavacara
        Cittas, twelve Arupavacara Cittas, and eight Lokuttara Cittas.</p>
      <p>The nineteen Sobhana Sadharana associate with fifty-nine Cittas, the three Virati with sixteen Cittas, the two
        Appamanna with twenty-eight Cittas, and the Panna Cetasika with forty-seven Cittas.</p>
      <p>Now find out in order how many Sobhana Cetasikas associate with each Sobhana Citta. Since the nineteen Sobhana
        Sadharana associate with all Sobhana Cittas, there is nothing special to look for about them. There are only six
        Sobhana Cetasikas that associate only with some Cittas. Therefore, finding the number of Cetasikas is not
        difficult.</p>
      <p><b>Special Facts</b></p>
      <p>Regarding the association of Virati Cetasikas in Kamavacara Kusala Citta, two facts should be specially noted:
        they associate sometimes, and when they associate, they do not all associate together but separately. Virati
        Cetasikas do not associate with Kamavacara Kusala Citta performing acts like giving alms, worshipping,
        preaching, listening to Dhamma, etc. They associate only on occasions when Sila is fulfilled by abstaining from
        misconduct with Kamavacara Kusala Citta. Abstaining from all misconduct cannot be done at once. When abstaining
        from verbal misconduct, abstaining from bodily misconduct does not happen. When abstaining from bodily
        misconduct, abstaining from verbal misconduct does not happen. When abstaining from lying with Samma Vaca
        Cetasika, it is abstaining from lying, not abstaining from tale-bearing etc. When abstaining from tale-bearing,
        it is not abstaining from lying etc. Because of these reasons, only one Virati Cetasika associates at a time in
        Kamavacara Kusala, not two or three. Since Rupavacara and Arupavacara Cittas are not Cittas arising as
        abstaining from misconduct, Virati Cetasikas do not associate with them.</p>
      <p>Sinful deeds are done by beings because of defilements. Defilements causing sinful deeds are destroyed by
        Lokuttara Magga Citta. Since abstaining from sinful deeds happens according to the destruction of defilements,
        all three Virati Cetasikas always associate with Lokuttara Cittas.</p>
      <p>Appamanna associate with Kamavacara Cittas only on occasions of compassion for suffering beings or rejoicing
        about happy beings. Since compassion and rejoicing about happy beings are two different tasks, both Appamanna
        Cetasikas do not associate in one Citta at the same time. Appamanna do not associate with Rupavacara Cittas
        taking Kasina etc. as objects. They associate only with Rupavacara Jhana Cittas developed by cultivating Karuna
        or Mudita.</p>
      <p>Among the fifty-two Cetasikas, the eleven Cetasikas Issa, Macchariya, Kukkucca, Samma Vaca, Samma Kammanta,
        Samma Ajiva, Karuna, Mudita, Mana, Thina, Middha associate with specific Cittas only sometimes. Therefore, they
        are called '<b>Aniyatayogi</b>'. The remaining forty-one Cetasikas are called '<b>Niyatayogi</b>' because they
        definitely associate with those respective Cittas.</p>
