      <p><b>Lesson 10</b></p>
      <p>Mind is a condition to mind in six ways. Mind is a condition to both mind and matter in five ways. Mind is a
        condition to matter in one way. Matter is a condition to mind in one way. Concepts, mind, and matter are
        conditions to mind in two ways. Mind and matter are conditions to mind and matter in nine ways. Thus, the
        conditioning is sixfold.</p>
      <p><b>The Six Ways Mind is a Condition to Mind</b></p>
      <p>The consciousnesses and mental factors that cease immediately are conditions to the consciousnesses and mental
        factors arising immediately after them by Anantara, Samanantara, Natthi, and Vigata forces. The preceding
        Javanas in respective processes are conditions to subsequent Javanas by Asevana force. The consciousness and
        mental factor dharmas arising together are conditions to each other by Sampayutta force. Thus, mind is a
        condition to mind in six ways.</p>
      <p><b>The Five Ways Mind is a Condition to Mind and Matter</b></p>
      <p>Hetu, Jhana factors, and Magga factors are conditions to conascent mind and matter by Hetu, Jhana, and Magga
        forces. Conascent volition is a condition to conascent mind and matter, and asynchronous volition is a condition
        to mind and matter produced by kamma. Resultant consciousnesses and mental factors are conditions to each other
        and to conascent matter by Vipaka force. Thus, mind is a condition to mind and matter in five ways.</p>
      <p><b>The One Way Mind is a Condition to Matter</b></p>
      <p>Subsequent consciousnesses and mental factors are conditions to this material body that arose earlier by
        Pacchajata force. Thus, mind is a condition to matter in one way.</p>
      <p><b>The One Way Matter is a Condition to Mind</b></p>
      <p>During the course of existence, the six base matters such as the eye are conditions to the seven consciousness
        elements, and the five objects such as form are conditions to the five-door process consciousnesses by Purejata
        force. Thus, matter is a condition to mind in one way.</p>
      <p><b>The Two Ways Concept, Mind, and Matter are Conditions to Mind</b></p>
      <p>All three - Concept, Mind, and Matter - are conditions to mind by Arammana force and Upanissaya force. Thus,
        Concepts, Mind, and Matter are conditions to mind in two ways.</p>
      <p><b>Mind and Matter being Conditions to Mind and Matter</b></p>
      <p>Mind and Matter are conditions to Mind and Matter appropriately by the nine conditioning forces: Adhipati,
        Sahajata, Annamanna, Nissaya, Ahara, Indriya, Vippayutta, Atthi, and Avigata.</p>
      <p>The entire group of dharmas, threefold as Concept, Mind, and Matter, belonging to the three times of past,
        future, and present, or not belonging to the three times, internal and external, belong to the twenty-four
        conditions appropriately. There is no dharma that is not some condition. From this group of dharmas, excluding
        Nirvana and Concepts, the remaining dharmas are also Paccayuppanna of those respective conditions.</p>
      <p><b>Mind and Matter</b></p>
      <p>The two words Nama and Rupa are two words frequently used in this Dhamma. The eighty-nine consciousnesses,
        fifty-two mental factors, and Nirvana are known by the name <b>Nama</b>. Those dharmas have no form. They are
        known by names such as Mind, Contact, Feeling, etc., upon hearing those names. They are given the name Nama
        because of that. The twenty-eight matters called the Matter Aggregate are <b>Rupa</b>. There are other meanings
        for the words Nama and Rupa. What is shown here is the meaning needed for this place. Namas are also called
        Arupa. The first of the five aggregates is the Matter Aggregate. The four aggregates - Feeling, Perception,
        Formations, Consciousness - are called Name Aggregates.</p>
