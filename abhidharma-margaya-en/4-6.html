      <p>In this Dhamma, the name “Vatthu” (Base) is used for the places located in the bodies of beings where Cittas
        arise.</p>
      <p>There are six Vatthus or places where Cittas arise: Cakkhu Vatthu, Sota Vatthu, Ghana Vatthu, Jivha Vatthu,
        Kaya Vatthu, Hadaya Vatthu.</p>
      <p>Cakkhu Vatthu is the Cakkhu Pasada mentioned as Cakkhu Dvara in the Summary of Doors. Sota - Ghana - Jivha -
        Kaya Vatthus are those respective Pasada Rupas themselves.</p>
      <p>The special thing among Vatthus is the Hadaya Vatthu. It is a certain subtle element existing depending on
        about half a cup of blood located in the heart chamber. It is a very subtle thing not seen by the eye - not
        caught by the hand. It is not present in the heart chamber of the dead. It is also not something caught by
        medical science. The name Vatthu Rupa is also used for it. That Vatthu Rupa, which helps the arising of Cittas
        flowing out as if from the heart chamber, does not go out mixed with the blood flowing out of the heart chamber.
        Most of the Cittas arise in the Hadaya Vatthu.</p>
      <p>Beings with complete faculties in the Kama Loka have all six Vatthus. Brahmas in the Rupa Loka do not have
        Ghana - Jivha - Kaya Vatthus. Arupa beings do not have even a single Vatthu.</p>
      <p>By saying that there are no Ghana - Jivha - Kaya Vatthus in Rupa Loka, it should not be taken that Rupavacara
        Brahmas do not have nose - tongue and body. What they do not have are the Ghana - Jivha - Kaya Pasadas which are
        the support for Cittas. Cakkhu Vatthu and Sota Vatthu are useful for things helpful for purity such as seeing
        the Buddha - listening to Dhamma. The three Vatthus Ghana etc. are useful only for the enjoyment of sensual
        pleasures and nothing else. To Brahmas born by the power of Kama Viraga Bhavana Kusala, the three Vatthus Ghana
        etc. do not arise. The two Vatthus Cakkhu - Sota arise for the purpose of seeing the Buddha - listening to
        Dhamma etc.</p>
      <p>There are three parts of Cittas: Cittas arising depending on a Vatthu, Cittas arising depending on and not
        depending on a Vatthu, and Cittas arising without depending on a Vatthu.</p>
      <p>The two Cakkhu Vinnanas arise depending on the Cakkhu Vatthu itself. Sota - Ghana - Jivha - Kaya Vinnanas also
        arise depending on those Vatthus.</p>
      <p>The thirty-three Cittas: Pancadvaravajjana, two Sampaticchanas, three Santiranas, eight Mahavipakas, two Dosa
        Mula Cittas, Sotapatti Magga Citta, Hasituppada, and fifteen Rupavacara Cittas arise depending on the Hadaya
        Vatthu itself.</p>
      <p>The forty-two Cittas: eight Kamavacara Kusala Cittas, four Arupa Kusala Cittas, eight Lobha Mula Cittas, two
        Moha Mula Cittas, Manodvaravajjana, eight Maha Kriya Cittas, four Arupa Kriya Cittas, and seven Lokuttara Cittas
        excluding the First Magga arise depending on the Hadaya Vatthu Rupa when arising in Kama - Rupa worlds, and
        arise without depending on a Vatthu when arising in Arupa world.</p>
      <p>The four Arupa Vipaka Cittas arise without depending on a Vatthu.</p>
      <p><b>Part II</b></p>
      <p>There are forty-three Cittas arising depending on a Vatthu. There are forty-two Cittas arising depending on and
        not depending on a Vatthu. There are four Cittas arising without depending on a Vatthu.</p>
      <p>Forty-three Cittas arise depending on a Vatthu because those Cittas do not arise in the Arupa world.</p>
      <p>Among those Cittas, Dvi Panca Vinnana - Pancadvaravajjana - Sampaticchana - Santirana - Maha Vipakas do not
        arise in the Arupa world because the doors where they arise and the functions performed by those Cittas are not
        there.</p>
      <p>Dosa Mula Cittas do not arise there because those Cittas do not arise in Jhana attainers.</p>
      <p>Hasituppada Citta is not there because there is no laughter of Arupa beings.</p>
      <p>Sotapatti Magga Citta does not arise there because Arupa beings without ears cannot hear Dhamma from others.
        Except for Lord Buddhas and Pacceka Buddhas, others cannot generate Sotapatti Magga by their own power without
        hearing Dhamma from others. Buddhas - Pacceka Buddhas do not arise in the Arupa world. There is no way for Arupa
        beings to hear anything from others. One who has become Sotapanna can attain the remaining Magga Phalas without
        the help of others. Sometimes those who became Sotapanna in Kama - Rupa worlds are born in the Arupa world. They
        attain Sakadagami - Anagami - Arahat Magga Phalas there itself and attain Parinibbana.</p>
