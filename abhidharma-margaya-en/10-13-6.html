      <p><b>Obhasa (Illumination), Piti (Joy), Passaddhi (Tranquillity), Adhimokkha (Resolution), Paggaha (Exertion),
          Sukha (Happiness), Nana (Knowledge), Upatthana (Mindfulness), Upekkha (Equanimity), Nikanti (Attachment)</b> -
        these ten are the imperfections of Vipassana. Imperfections of Vipassana are a group of factors that mislead the
        yogi and obstruct Vipassana. They do not arise for yogis who have not done Vipassana well. Their arising is a
        sign that Vipassana has been done well up to that point.</p>
      <p><b>Obhasa</b> is a special light visible only to the yogi and not to others, arising solely from the power of
        Vipassana. For some yogis, it arises such that only their body is visible, for some such that the entire room
        they are in is visible, and for some such that a distance of leagues - yojanas is visible.</p>
      <p><b>Piti</b> is the strong joy that arises due to the goodness of Vipassana knowledge and seeing the arising and
        passing away of formations very well.</p>
      <p><b>Passaddhi</b> is the tranquillity of body and mind arising from Vipassana. Due to that tranquillity, the
        yogi can engage in meditation as long as he wishes without any difficulty. He does not even feel the passage of
        time.</p>
      <p><b>Adhimokkha</b> is strong faith. At this stage, a strong faith that pleases the mind exceedingly arises in
        the yogi along with the Vipassana consciousness.</p>
      <p><b>Paggaha</b> is effort. At this stage, a good effort which is neither too slack nor too rapid arises in the
        yogi along with the Vipassana consciousness.</p>
      <p><b>Sukha</b> is a strong happiness that pleases the entire body, spreading throughout the entire body, arising
        with the Vipassana consciousness.</p>
      <p><b>Nana</b> is the very sharp Vipassana knowledge that penetrates into material and immaterial dhammas.</p>
      <p><b>Upatthana</b> is the mindfulness mental factor associated with Vipassana consciousness. At this stage, a
        strong mindfulness arises in the yogi that is established on the formations being contemplated, without the mind
        shaking like a mountain.</p>
      <p><b>Upekkha</b> is the two equanimities: Tatramajjhattata Upekkha and Avajjana Upekkha.</p>
      <p><b>Nikanti</b> is the subtle craving that attaches to the Vipassana adorned with illumination etc. It is a very
        subtle greed that is difficult to recognize as a defilement. The real imperfection of Vipassana is that Nikanti.
        Illumination etc. become imperfections because they are causes for Nikanti.</p>
      <p>When illumination etc. appear, the unskilled yogi thinks "Never before has such a light - such joy - such
        wisdom arisen in me. Now these wonderful things are arising in me because I have attained the Path and Fruit,"
        and abandons meditation. He behaves saying he has become a Sotapanna without being a Sotapanna, or saying he has
        become an Arahant without being an Arahant. The skilled yogi understands that a subtle craving arises regarding
        illumination etc., and if it grows, he will fall away from the path to Nirvana and fall back into the path of
        Samsara. To remove that craving, he contemplates illumination etc. as impermanent, as suffering because they
        cause fear, and as non-self because they are unsubstantial, and removes the craving arising regarding
        illumination etc. The knowledge that understands the characteristics of the true path and the false path of the
        yogi who has thus considered the obstructive dhammas to Vipassana such as illumination as impermanent etc. and
        removed the craving, is the Maggamagga Nanadassana Visuddhi.</p>
