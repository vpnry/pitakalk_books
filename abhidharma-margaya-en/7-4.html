      <p><b>Akasa Dhatu</b></p>
      <p>Akasa Dhatu is spoken of in two ways: Ajatakasa and Rupa Paricchedakasa. The space of the world which is the
        place for the existence of all objects and persons is called Ajatakasa. The space that separates Rupa Kalapas in
        solid objects from one another is called Pariccheda Akasa. What is counted as one of the twenty-eight Rupas is
        that Pariccheda Akasa. This Akasa Dhatu is not a real Paramattha Dhamma with a separate arising. However, since
        Akasa is also needed between Rupa Kalapas for their unmixed existence, it is counted as one Rupa.</p>
      <p><b>Vikara Rupas</b></p>
      <p><b>Kaya Vinnatti</b></p>
      <p>The special force that turns the speed of the Cittaja Vayo which moves bodily limbs in various directions
        suitable for respective actions is called Kaya Vinnatti. When a Citta associated with the effort to perform a
        certain action arises, by the power of that mind, just as light spreads throughout a dark room when a match is
        struck, air (Vayo) arises throughout the bodily limbs that need to be moved. Bodily limbs move by that speed of
        air. The Vinnatti Rupa also arises together with that air. By it, the speed of air is directed to the required
        direction. Upward and downward movements etc. of bodily limbs happen as required for the action due to that
        direction.</p>
      <p><b>Vaci Vinnatti</b></p>
      <p>The special force that directs the sound so that required letters and required words are formed when making an
        effort to speak is called Vaci Vinnatti. Sound arises by the striking of Cittaja Vayo at respective places. That
        sound arises as required for the matter due to this Vaci Vinnatti Rupa. The name Vinnatti is given to these
        because the intention of the person is intimated by them.</p>
      <p><b>Lahutadi Three Rupas</b></p>
      <p>The lightness of bodily Rupas is Lahuta. Softness - absence of hardness is Muduta. Suitability for action or
        wieldiness is Kammannata. These three Rupas are three qualities of other Rupas. Due to bad weather, bad mind,
        taking unsuitable food, not getting enough food, occurrence of various diseases etc., a heavy nature in the body
        unable to work quickly, a hard nature causing pain in bending and stretching, and a nature unable to move the
        body as required arise. When the weather is good, mind is good, suitable food and drink are obtained etc., these
        Rupas called Lahuta, Muduta, Kammannata arise in the body.</p>
      <p>These five Rupas namely two Vinnatti Rupas and three Lahutadi Rupas are called Vikara Rupas. They are special
        modes that arise in the Rupa body from time to time. The name Vikara Rupa is given for that reason. </p>
      <p><b>Four Laksana Rupas</b></p>
      <p>Upacaya - Santati - Jarata - Aniccata are the four Laksana Rupas. Both words Upacaya and Santati refer to the
        arising of Rupas. The arising of Rupas before the Rupas that should arise for a being are completed is called
        Upacaya. The arising of Rupas that appear again and again replacing the Rupas that break up after the Rupas are
        completed is called Santati. The decaying of Rupas is Jarata. The breaking up is Aniccata. Since these are
        characteristics of other Rupas, they are called Laksana Rupas.</p>
      <p>These ten Rupas namely Pariccheda Rupa, five Vikara Rupas, and four Laksana Rupas are called Anipphanna Rupas
        because they are not Rupas produced directly by causes such as Kamma.</p>
      <p>Among these Rupas, the lifespan of the two Vinnatti Rupas is one Citta Khana. The lifespan of Upacaya and
        Santati Rupas is one small Khana (sub-moment). The lifespan of Jarata Rupa is forty-nine small Khanas. The
        lifespan of Aniccata Rupa is one small Khana. The lifespan of the remaining twenty-two Rupas is seventeen Citta
        Khanas.</p>
