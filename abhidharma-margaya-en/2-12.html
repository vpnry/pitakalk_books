      <p>Cittas that arise in someone's mental continuum and produce desired results in the future for that person are
        called Kusala Cittas (Moral Consciousness). The merit that arises in ordinary people through giving (Dana),
        observing virtue (Sila), etc., is Kamavacara Kusala. Due to strong faith, receiving desired objects for
        offering, and receiving pleasant recipients, that Kusala Citta arises associated with Joy (Somanassa). In
        instances where those are not obtained, it arises associated with Neutral Feeling (Upekkha). Therefore, the
        Kusala Citta, which is generally one, becomes two as Somanassa-sahagata Citta and Upekkha-sahagata Citta.
        Sometimes that Kusala arises associated with wisdom knowing Kamma and its result, and sometimes without wisdom.
        Therefore, the Somanassa-sahagata Citta is also divided into two as Nana-sampayutta (Associated with Knowledge)
        Citta and Nana-vippayutta (Dissociated from Knowledge) Citta. By such division, there are four Kusala Cittas.
        Each of those four is again divided into two based on Sankhara (Prompting). By such division, there are eight
        Kamavacara Kusala Cittas.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Somanassa-sahagata Nana-sampayutta Asankharika Citta (Unprompted Consciousness associated with Joy and
            Knowledge).</b></li>
        <li><b>Somanassa-sahagata Nana-sampayutta Sasankharika Citta (Prompted Consciousness associated with Joy and
            Knowledge).</b></li>
        <li><b>Somanassa-sahagata Nana-vippayutta Asankharika Citta (Unprompted Consciousness associated with Joy and
            dissociated from Knowledge).</b></li>
        <li><b>Somanassa-sahagata Nana-vippayutta Sasankharika Citta (Prompted Consciousness associated with Joy and
            dissociated from Knowledge).</b></li>
        <li><b>Upekkha-sahagata Nana-sampayutta Asankharika Citta (Unprompted Consciousness associated with Neutral
            Feeling and Knowledge).</b></li>
        <li><b>Upekkha-sahagata Nana-sampayutta Sasankharika Citta (Prompted Consciousness associated with Neutral
            Feeling and Knowledge).</b></li>
        <li><b>Upekkha-sahagata Nana-vippayutta Asankharika Citta (Unprompted Consciousness associated with Neutral
            Feeling and dissociated from Knowledge).</b></li>
        <li><b>Upekkha-sahagata Nana-vippayutta Sasankharika Citta (Prompted Consciousness associated with Neutral
            Feeling and dissociated from Knowledge).</b></li>
      </ol>
      <p>These eight are the Kamavacara Kusala Cittas.</p>
      <p>This Kamavacara Kusala is also called <b>Maha Kusala</b>. It is called so not because it is superior to
        Rupavacara, Arupavacara, and Lokuttara Kusalas, but because it is a Kusala that arises in many people living
        everywhere in the world. Rupavacara, Arupavacara, and Lokuttara Kusalas arise rarely only in very few people.
      </p>
      <p>The eight Kamavacara Kusala Cittas arise by way of performing the ten meritorious deeds: Dana (Giving), Sila
        (Virtue), Bhavana (Meditation), Apacayana (Reverence), Veyyavacca (Service), Pattidana (Transference of Merit),
        Pattanumodana (Rejoicing in others' merit), Dhammasavana (Listening to Dhamma), Dhammadesana (Preaching Dhamma),
        and Ditthijjukamma (Straightening one's views).</p>
      <p>Among the fifty-two mental factors (Cetasikas), there is a certain mental factor called Cetana (Volition).
        There are many varieties of Cetana such as Dana Cetana, Sila Cetana, Bhavana Cetana, Panatipata Cetana,
        Adattadana Cetana, Micchacara Cetana, etc. It is by Cetana that the mind is turned towards various directions.
      </p>
      <p>Out of the eight Maha Kusala Cittas, each Citta becomes ten according to Dana Cetana etc., such as
        Somanassa-sahagata Nana-sampayutta Asankharika Dana-maya Kusala, Somanassa-sahagata Nana-sampayutta Asankharika
        Sila-maya Kusala, etc. When all are added together, there are eighty (80) Kamavacara Kusala Cittas according to
        the ten meritorious volitions.</p>
      <p>The strength in a mind is the Cetana itself that turns the mind in various directions. A Kusala associated with
        a sharp and great Cetana is powerful. It has great results. A Kusala associated with a weak, small Cetana is
        weak; it has little results.</p>
      <p>Someone gives a cent to a beggar with a Somanassa-sahagata Nana-sampayutta Asankharika Citta. On another day,
        he gives a rupee to the same beggar with the same Citta. On both occasions, the same Citta arises. However, the
        Cetana of giving a rupee is greater than the Cetana of giving a cent. Therefore, it should be said that the
        Somanassa-sahagata Nana-sampayutta Asankharika Citta arising on the day of giving the rupee is powerful and
        produces great results. In this manner, the smallness or greatness of Kusalas should be considered according to
        Cetana everywhere.</p>
      <p>The main factor for a Kusala to be superior or powerful is being Nana-sampayutta (associated with knowledge). A
        Nana-vippayutta Kusala is not superior to a Nana-sampayutta Kusala due to factors like being Somanassa-sahagata.
        The states of being Somanassa-sahagata, Upekkha-sahagata, Asankharika, and Sasankharika are secondary factors
        regarding Kusala. Generally speaking, it is said that Somanassa-sahagata Kusala is superior to Upekkha-sahagata
        Kusala, and Asankharika Kusala is superior to Sasankharika Kusala. A Nana-vippayutta Kusala is not superior to a
        Nana-sampayutta Kusala by any factor.</p>
      <p><b>Method of Arising of Kamavacara Kusala Cittas</b></p>
      <p>When performing acts like giving alms with joy, with wisdom knowing Kamma and result, and without anyone's
        instigation, the Somanassa-sahagata Nana-sampayutta Asankharika Citta arises.</p>
      <p>When performing acts like giving alms with joy and wisdom, but with instigation, the Somanassa-sahagata
        Nana-sampayutta Sasankharika Citta arises.</p>
      <p>When performing acts like giving alms only with joy, without wisdom, and without anyone's instigation, the
        Somanassa-sahagata Nana-vippayutta Asankharika Citta arises.</p>
      <p>When performing acts like giving alms with joy, without wisdom, and with instigation, the Somanassa-sahagata
        Nana-vippayutta Sasankharika Citta arises.</p>
      <p>Consider how the four Upekkha-sahagata Kusala Cittas arise when performing the said acts without joy, with
        neutrality.</p>
