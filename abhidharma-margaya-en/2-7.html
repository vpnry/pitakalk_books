      <p>(1) The <b>Somanassa-sahagata Ditthigata-sampayutta Asankharika Citta</b> arises when one steals property
        belonging to others with great joy and without anyone's inducement, holding some wrong view such as "There is no
        fault in taking what the rich man has in excess" or "There is no fault in taking this wealth earned unjustly";
        or when one eats food enjoying the taste with great joy and without anyone's inducement, holding a wrong view
        such as "These are given to us by God".</p>
      <p>(2) The <b>Somanassa-sahagata Ditthigata-sampayutta Sasankharika Citta</b> arises when one does the above
        actions due to the inducement of another or by making one's own hesitant mind effortless by oneself.</p>
      <p>(3) The <b>Somanassa-sahagata Ditthigata-vippayutta Asankharika Citta</b> arises when one steals others'
        property with joy without holding any wrong view and without anyone's inducement, or when one eats delicious
        food with joy without holding a wrong view and without anyone's inducement.</p>
      <p>(4) The <b>Somanassa-sahagata Ditthigata-vippayutta Sasankharika Citta</b> arises when one does the above
        actions (in 3) due to the inducement of others or by making one's own mind effortless by oneself.</p>
      <p>(5) The <b>Upekkha-sahagata Ditthigata-sampayutta Asankharika Citta</b> arises when one steals others' property
        without joy (with neutral feeling) and without anyone's inducement, holding some wrong view such as "There is no
        sin in taking from a man who has excess"; or when one drinks intoxicants without joy and without anyone's
        inducement, holding a wrong view such as "These are given by God".</p>
      <p>(6) The <b>Upekkha-sahagata Ditthigata-sampayutta Sasankharika Citta</b> arises when one does the above actions
        (in 5) due to the inducement of others or by making one's own hesitant mind effortless by oneself.</p>
      <p>(7) The <b>Upekkha-sahagata Ditthigata-vippayutta Asankharika Citta</b> arises when one commits stealing etc.
        without holding a wrong view, without joy, and without anyone's inducement.</p>
      <p>(8) The <b>Upekkha-sahagata Ditthigata-vippayutta Sasankharika Citta</b> arises when one does so due to the
        inducement of someone or by making one's own hesitant mind effortless by oneself.</p>
      <p>Lobhamula Cittas arising as the commission of Akusala Kamma Pathas like stealing are powerful in giving
        results. Lobhamula Cittas arising as attachment to wife, children, and wealth are weak. Their giving of results
        is also uncertain. The Ditthigata-sampayutta Akusala Citta is more powerful than the Ditthigata-vippayutta
        Citta. The Asankharika Citta is more powerful than the Sasankharika Citta. The Upekkha-sahagata Citta is more
        powerful than the Somanassa-sahagata Citta (in terms of Akusala/Unwholesomeness? - <i>Note: Usually Somanassa is
          considered stronger in Lobha, but Upekkha might be considered stronger in some contexts or this might be a
          specific view of the author. Wait, standard Abhidhamma usually says Somanassa is stronger for Lobha. Let me
          check the text again. "සෝමනස්ස සහගත සිතට වඩා උපේක්ෂා සහගත සිත බලවත් ය." It literally says Upekkha sahagata
          citta is more powerful than Somanassa sahagata citta. I will translate it as is.</i>)</p>
