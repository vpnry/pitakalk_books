      </div>
      <p>When this world containing beings is analyzed very subtly, the very subtle natures found at the very end are
        the Paramartha Dharmas (Ultimate Realities). The fundamental natures of everything belonging to the world are
        the Paramarthas. They are not substances like stones, clay lumps etc., but forces. Therefore, they do not have
        shapes like long, short, small, large, round, square etc.</p>
      <p>In brief, there are four Paramarthas: <b>Citta, Cetasika, Rupa, Nirvana</b>.</p>
      <p><b>Citta (Consciousness)</b></p>
      <p>Among the four Paramarthas, Citta is knowing. It is also called 'Sita'. This knowing arises due to the five
        faculties: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and due to the pure mind door. The knowing that arises due to the eye
        is called seeing, and the knowing that arises due to the ear is called hearing. The words seeing, appearing,
        thinking, ideas occurring refer to <b>Citta</b> or <b>Sita</b>. The things that are known are called
        <b>Aramuna</b> (Object). A <b>Citta</b> never arises without the connection of an object. Just as distinct drum
        sounds arise from the impact when a drum is beaten, distinct Cittas arise regarding objects when they impinge on
        the faculties. All those knowings are actions. Therefore, all arising Cittas perish immediately. It should be
        remembered that Citta or Sita is mere knowing.
      </p>
      <p><b>Cetasika (Mental Factors)</b></p>
      <p>When a Citta or knowing of an object arises, the other actions that arise mixed with that act of knowing are
        Cetasikas. There are fifty-two Cetasikas. Arising together with the Citta, perishing together, taking the object
        taken by the Citta, and depending on the same base as the Citta are the four common characteristics of
        Cetasikas. Cetasikas are never born separate from Citta. Nor do they have the power to be born without a Citta.
        Citta also does not have the power to be born completely devoid of Cetasikas. However, Citta is born without
        some Cetasikas. One Citta is not born with all Cetasikas. </p>
      <p><b>Rupa (Matter)</b></p>
      <p>The collection of fundamental natures from which living bodies and external objects are made are Rupas. There
        are twenty-eight Rupas. Of them, only one Rupa called Varna Dhatu (Color Element) is visible to the eye. The
        remaining twenty-seven are not Rupas visible to the eye. The meaning of the word Rupa is 'that which undergoes
        change by contact with opposing things like cold and heat'. Since Citta and Cetasikas are very subtle, there is
        no collision of them with cold and heat etc. </p>
      <p><b>Nirvana</b></p>
      <p>Nirvana is the peaceful, happy nature free from the fires of defilements like lust and fires of suffering like
        birth, decay, disease, death. Citta, Cetasika, Rupa Paramarthas are natures that arise solely from the gathering
        of appropriate causes to produce those respective natures. <b>Since they are produced by causes, they are called
          Sankhata Dharmas (Conditioned Realities).</b> Sankhata Dharmas break up without lasting even a moment after
        arising. Therefore, they are Anicca (Impermanent) Dharmas. The Nirvana element is a nature that exists without
        being produced by any cause. Therefore, it is called the Asankhata Dhatu (Unconditioned Element). It is a nature
        that never ceases and exists at all times. It is a very deep nature. It is a nature that can be realized only
        with great effort. Aryas are freed from the suffering of Samsara by realizing it through cultivating the
        Supramundane Path. The highest thing to be expected by practicing according to Buddhism is that Nirvana. </p>
