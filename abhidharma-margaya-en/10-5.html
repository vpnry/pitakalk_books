      <p><b>Lesson 8</b></p>
      <p>There are five Abhinnas: “<b>Iddhividha Abhinna, Dibbasota Abhinna, Paracittavijanana Abhinna,
          Pubbenivasanussati Abhinna, Dibbacakkhu Abhinna”</b>.</p>
      <p>Abhinna is a name given to the Rupavacara Fifth Jhana consciousness endowed with special power. The Rupavacara
        Fifth Jhana consciousness capable of performing acts such as becoming invisible, going through the sky, walking
        on water, diving into the earth, and creating various things is called Iddhividha Abhinna.</p>
      <p>The Rupavacara Fifth Jhana capable of hearing very subtle sounds not audible to the human ear and sounds
        arising far away as if hearing with the ear is called Dibbasota Abhinna.</p>
      <p>The Rupavacara Fifth Jhana consciousness capable of seeing others' minds is called Paracittavijanana Abhinna.
      </p>
      <p>The Rupavacara Fifth Jhana consciousness capable of recollecting one's own past lives is called
        Pubbenivasanussati Abhinna.</p>
      <p>The Rupavacara Fifth Jhana consciousness capable of seeing subtle things not visible to the human eye, things
        located far away, and things covered by walls, mountains etc. as if seeing with the eye is called Dibbacakkhu
        Abhinna.</p>
      <p>Abhinna is not obtained merely by obtaining Jhana or by becoming an Arahant. Abhinna power should be obtained
        by making effort again after obtaining Jhana. To those who had developed Jhana Abhinna in recent past lives and
        to Great Bodhisattvas who have fulfilled Bodhi requisites, Abhinna power is obtained effortlessly along with
        obtaining Jhana. For ordinary Jhana attainers who wish to obtain Abhinna, Abhinna power cannot be obtained
        without training the mind in the fourteen ways shown in Visuddhimagga etc. such as “Kasinanulomato
        Kasinapatilomato” (Kasina forward order, Kasina backward order) regarding the Eight Attainments.</p>
      <p>There are two methods of seeking Rupavacara Jhanas called the Pentad method and Tetrad method. In this book,
        Rupavacara Jhanas are shown according to the Pentad method. In the Citta chapter, fifteen Rupavacara
        consciousnesses are mentioned according to the Pentad method of Jhanas. Some yogis who have generated the
        Rupavacara First Jhana, transcending both Jhana factors Vitakka and Vicara at once, generate the Jhana having
        the three factors Piti, Sukha, Ekaggata for the second time. To them, it is the Second Jhana. According to the
        Pentad method, it is the Third Jhana. They generate the Fourth Jhana of the Pentad method for the third time,
        and the Fifth Jhana for the fourth time. They have four Rupavacara Jhanas as First Jhana, Second Jhana, Third
        Jhana, and Fourth Jhana. The name Samapatti is also used for Jhanas. Therefore, these eight, the four Rupavacara
        Jhanas and the four Arupavacara Jhanas, are called <b>Eight Attainments (Ashta Samapatti)</b>.</p>
      <p>The attainer of Eight Attainments should generate Rupavacara Jhanas from all eight Kasinas: Pathavi, Apo, Tejo,
        Vayo, Nila, Pita, Lohita, Odata. Then, the Eight Attainments should be practiced in all fourteen ways shown in
        Visuddhimagga such as entering Jhanas in order in Kasinas from Pathavi Kasina to Odata Kasina, entering Jhanas
        in all Kasinas in reverse order from Odata Kasina, entering Jhanas in both those ways etc. To the Rupavacara
        Fifth Jhana consciousness of the yogi who has practiced thus, the power to perform Iddhi miracles is obtained.
      </p>
      <p>When the yogi who has developed the power of the Rupavacara Fifth Jhana consciousness by practicing the Eight
        Attainments in fourteen ways wishes to perform some special thing by its power, first he should enter the Fifth
        Jhana in a Kasina suitable for the task he is going to do. That Fifth Jhana is called ‘Abhinnapadaka Pancama
        Jhana’ (Fifth Jhana as base for Abhinna). If it is to create something, having emerged from it, thinking “May
        such thing be created, be created” a few times, he should enter that Fifth Jhana again. Having emerged from it,
        he should resolve again “May such thing be created”. At that occasion, the Rupavacara Fifth Jhana consciousness
        called Abhinna consciousness endowed with special power arises by way of resolution. As soon as that
        consciousness arises, the form intended by the yogi appears.</p>
      <p>All Abhinnas are not obtained just by developing the fourteen-fold mastery in the Eight Attainments as
        mentioned above. There are separate preliminary works to be done for Abhinnas such as Dibbasota. Yogis who have
        completed the preliminary works suitable for obtaining those respective Abhinnas have those respective Abhinnas.
        Among Abhinnas, some have only one. Some have two or three. Some have all. Therefore, some Jhana attainers see
        the bodies of devas and brahmas invisible to the human eye. But they are not capable of hearing their voices.
        Some are capable of hearing distant sounds. But they are not capable of seeing distant forms. Some are capable
        of doing both. But they are unable to create anything. It should also be known that nothing happens just by a
        Jhana attainer merely thinking or saying "May something happen".</p>
