      <p>Rupas are not born individually. Rupas also do not have the power to be born or exist alone without being
        connected to other Rupas. They arise and exist in groups. In each such group, there are at least eight Rupas.
        Those groups of Rupas that arise together are called Rupa Kalapas.</p>
      <p>The Rupa Kalapa has a boundary limit. The separate Rupas belonging to the Rupa Kalapa do not have a boundary
        limit. Rupas in one Kalapa exist as if one Rupa is immersed in other Rupas. As if other Rupas are immersed in
        that Rupa. In other words, it is as if one Rupa has swallowed other Rupas. As if other Rupas have swallowed that
        Rupa. There is no simile to explain this matter clearly. However, a simile that helps to understand the matter
        slightly can be shown. It is as follows:-</p>
      <p>If a small amount of each of the four types of flour namely rice flour - wheat flour - kurakkan flour - barley
        flour is taken, mixed well, kneaded with water and made into a ball, if asked "Where is the rice flour?", it
        should be said that it is immersed in the remaining three parts of flour. If asked "Where is the wheat flour?",
        it should be said that it is also immersed in the remaining three parts of flour. If asked "Where is the
        kurakkan flour?", it should be said that it is also immersed in the remaining three parts of flour. If asked
        "Where is the barley flour?", it should be said that it is also immersed in the remaining three parts of flour.
        Now if all that is looked at together, you will be able to understand that those four types of flour exist
        swallowing each other. It should be known that just like flour in the flour ball, Rupas in a Rupa Kalapa are
        mixed as if swallowing each other. Although mixed, in the flour ball there are small pieces of flour separately.
        In Rupas of a Rupa Kalapa, there is no such separate existence. There is a complete mixture without gap. The
        size of a Rupa Kalapa cannot be stated. It is something invisible to the eye, much smaller than even an atom.
      </p>
      <p>Arising together, breaking together, having one support, existing together are the characteristics of a Rupa
        Kalapa. The formation of Rupa Kalapas also happens according to a method. Therefore, there are twenty-one Rupa
        Kalapas. Of those twenty-one, there are nine Kalapas produced by Kamma. There are six Kalapas produced by Citta.
        There are four Kalapas produced by Utu. There are two Kalapas produced by Ahara.</p>
      <p><b>Nine Kammaja Kalapas</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>The Kalapa formed by the combination of ten Rupas namely Jivita Rupa, eight Avinibbhoga Rupas, and Cakkhu
          Prasada is called <b>Cakkhu Dasaka</b> Kalapa.</li>
        <li>The Kalapa formed by the combination of Sotra Prasada to these nine namely Jivita Rupa and eight Avinibbhoga
          Rupas is called <b>Sotra Dasaka</b> Kalapa.</li>
        <li>The Kalapa formed by the combination of Ghana Prasada to those nine is called <b>Ghana Dasaka</b> Kalapa.
        </li>
        <li>The Kalapa formed by the combination of Jivha Prasada to those nine is called <b>Jivha Dasaka</b>.</li>
        <li>The Kalapa formed by the combination of Kaya Prasada is called <b>Kaya Dasaka</b>.</li>
        <li>The Kalapa formed by the combination of Itthi Bhava Rupa is called <b>Itthibhava Dasaka</b>.</li>
        <li>The Kalapa formed by the combination of Purisa Bhava Rupa is called <b>Pumbhava Dasaka</b>.</li>
        <li>The Kalapa formed by the combination of Hadaya Rupa is called <b>Vatthu Dasaka</b>.</li>
        <li>The Kalapa formed by the combination of Jivita Rupa to the eight Avinibbhoga Rupas is called <b>Jivita
            Navaka</b>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Thus there are nine Kammaja Kalapas.</p>
      <p><b>Six Cittaja Kalapas</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>The eight Avinibbhoga Rupas are called Suddhashtaka Kalapa.</li>
        <li>The Kalapa formed by the combination of Kaya Vinnatti also to those eight is called <b>Kayavinnatti
            Navaka</b>.</li>
        <li>The Kalapa formed by the combination of Vaci Vinnatti and Sabda Rupa to those eight is called
          <b>Vacivinnatti Dasaka</b>.
        </li>
        <li>The Kalapa formed by the combination of three Lahutadi to the eight Avinibbhoga Rupas is called
          <b>Lahutadekadasaka</b>.
        </li>
        <li>The Kalapa formed by the combination of Kaya Vinnatti and three Lahutadi to the eight Avinibbhoga Rupas is
          called <b>Kayavinnatti Lahutadi Dvadasaka</b>.</li>
        <li>The Kalapa formed by the combination of Vaci Vinnatti, Sabda, and three Lahutadi to the eight Avinibbhoga
          Rupas is called <b>Vacivinnatti Sadda Lahutadi Terasaka</b>. Thus there are six Cittaja Kalapas.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>Four Utuja Kalapas</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Suddhashtaka Kalapa</li>
        <li>Sabda Navaka Kalapa</li>
        <li>Lahutadekadasaka Kalapa</li>
        <li>Sabda Lahutadi Dvadasaka Kalapa</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Thus there are four Utuja Kalapas.</p>
      <p><b>Two Ahara Kalapas</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Suddhashtaka</li>
        <li>Lahutadekadasaka</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Thus there are two Aharaja Kalapas.</p>
      <p>Of these twenty-one Rupa Kalapas, the two Utuja Kalapas namely Suddhashtaka and Sabda Navaka exist outside the
        body of beings also. The remaining nineteen Kalapas are found only in the bodies of beings, not outside.</p>
      <p>If there is anything in the world such as earth - stones - fire - water - wind - flowers - leaves - fruits -
        bark - roots - heartwood etc., all of them are Suddhashtaka Kalapas only. In the bodies of beings also, mostly
        there are Suddhashtaka Kalapas. Manifold objects completely different from one another in color, shape, taste,
        qualities like hardness, softness, roughness, smoothness etc., and weight are formed from the same Suddhashtaka
        Kalapa due to the difference of the Maha Bhutas that make up the Suddhashtaka Kalapas. In some Suddhashtaka
        Kalapas, Pathavi Dhatu is prominent. The other three Dhatus are weak. In some, Pathavi and Apo Dhatus are
        prominent and the other two Dhatus are weak. Thus, due to differences in respective Dhatus, there are thousands
        of types of Suddhashtaka Kalapas. It is due to this diversity of Dhatus that manifold objects are formed from
        the same Suddhashtaka Kalapa. Since Akasa Dhatu is something that exists outside of Kalapas separating Rupa
        Kalapas from one another, it does not belong to Kalapas. Since the four Laksana Rupas are merely characteristics
        of Kalapas, they are not included in them.</p>
