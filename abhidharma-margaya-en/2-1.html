      <p>The Dhamma that analyzes and shows the root elements that make up all beings great and small such as gods,
        humans, elephants, horses, cattle, flies, mosquitoes etc., and all objects such as soil, rocks, water, wind,
        trees, creepers etc., and teaches how those root elements arise and exist as a lineage, and analyzes and shows
        the element of Nibbana is <b>Abhidharma</b>.</p>
      <p>It is only by learning Abhidharma that one can correctly know that these beings such as humans living now
        existed in the past, that they will be born again and again after death, and how rebirth occurs.</p>
      <p>It is only by learning Abhidharma that one can correctly understand that there is something called merit, there
        is something called demerit, the power in those merits and demerits, and how merits and demerits give happiness
        and suffering to beings.</p>
      <p>It is only by learning Abhidharma that one can correctly know that these are merits and these are demerits.</p>
      <p>It is only by learning Abhidharma that one can know that there are many beings belonging to various classes
        such as Devas and Brahmas with various forms and various kinds of happiness and suffering, invisible to our
        eyes, both near us and far away from us.</p>
      <p>It is only by learning Abhidharma that one can correctly understand what Nibbana is and what the path to
        Nibbana is.</p>
      <p>One does not accept that there is a future birth, does not accept that beings receive happiness and suffering
        according to kamma, does not accept that there are hells and that there are gods and brahmas, because of not
        knowing this Dhamma.</p>
      <p>Wrong views such as "there is no need to worship Buddha statues", "there is no need to offer flowers, lamps,
        food etc. to the inanimate Buddha" arise because of not knowing this Dhamma.</p>
      <p>Even if one is a Buddhist, a person who does not know this Dhamma even to some extent is a blind worldling
        (Andha Puthujjana). He cannot understand well by listening to a sermon or reading a Dhamma book. To be able to
        understand well a sermon that is delivered, and to be able to understand well by reading a Dhamma book, one must
        have learnt Abhidharma at least to some extent.</p>
      <p>The Dhamma of the Buddha is divided into three parts: Sutta Pitaka, Vinaya Pitaka, and Abhidharma Pitaka. The
        Abhidharma Pitaka consists of seven books (Prakaranas).</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Dhammasangani Prakarana </li>
        <li>Vibhanga Prakarana</li>
        <li>Dhatukatha Prakarana </li>
        <li>Puggalapannatti Prakarana</li>
        <li>Kathavatthu Prakarana </li>
        <li>Yamaka Prakarana</li>
        <li>Patthana Prakarana</li>
      </ol>
      <p>are the names of those seven books.</p>
