      <p>In this Dhamma, the six mental factors (Cetasikas) namely Lobha (Greed), Dosa (Hatred), Moha (Delusion), Alobha
        (Non-greed), Adosa (Non-hatred), and Amoha (Non-delusion) are called Hetu (Roots). A Citta associated with at
        least one of these six Cetasikas called Hetu is called a Sahetuka Citta (Rooted Consciousness). Cittas in which
        not a single Hetu Dhamma is found are called Ahetuka Cittas (Rootless Consciousness). There are three parts of
        Ahetuka Cittas: Akusala Vipaka (Unwholesome Resultant), Kusala Vipaka (Wholesome Resultant), and Kriya
        (Functional). It should be specially remembered that the name Ahetuka is used for these Cittas not because they
        arise automatically without any cause, but because none of the six Dhammas called Hetu (Lobha etc.) are present
        in them. (A description of Hetu will be given in a future chapter.) Since there are seven Akusala Vipaka Cittas,
        eight Kusala Vipaka Cittas, and three Kriya Cittas, there are eighteen (18) Ahetuka Cittas.</p>
      <p>Vipaka (Resultant) means Cittas that arise in the future in the continuity of the person who performed Kusala
        (Wholesome) and Akusala (Unwholesome) deeds, due to those Kusala and Akusala deeds. They are Cittas caused to
        arise in the future by the power of Kusala and Akusala.</p>
      <p><b>The Seven Akusala Vipaka Cittas</b></p>
      <p>Although Akusala Vipaka is generally one, there are seven Akusala Vipaka Cittas based on the places where the
        Cittas arise and the functions performed by the Cittas.</p>
      <p>There are six places where Cittas arise: the Eye, the Ear, the Nose, the Tongue, the Body, and the Heart Base
        (Hadaya Rupa). (Details about these will be known later.) Among Vipaka Cittas, there are Cittas arising in the
        eye. There are Cittas arising in the ear, Cittas arising in the nose, Cittas arising in the tongue, and Cittas
        arising in the body. Names have been given to those Cittas according to the place of arising. Since Cittas
        arising in the Heart Base are many, they cannot be named according to the place of origin. For Cittas arising in
        the heart among Ahetuka Cittas, names have been given according to the function performed by each Citta.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Upekkha-sahagata Cakkhu Vinnana (Eye Consciousness associated with Neutral Feeling)</b></li>
        <li><b>Upekkha-sahagata Sota Vinnana (Ear Consciousness associated with Neutral Feeling)</b></li>
        <li><b>Upekkha-sahagata Ghana Vinnana (Nose Consciousness associated with Neutral Feeling)</b></li>
        <li><b>Upekkha-sahagata Jivha Vinnana (Tongue Consciousness associated with Neutral Feeling)</b></li>
        <li><b>Dukkha-sahagata Kaya Vinnana (Body Consciousness associated with Pain)</b></li>
        <li><b>Upekkha-sahagata Sampaticchana (Receiving Consciousness associated with Neutral Feeling)</b></li>
        <li><b>Upekkha-sahagata Santirana (Investigating Consciousness associated with Neutral Feeling)</b></li>
      </ol>
      <p>These seven are Akusala Vipaka Cittas.</p>
      <p>The meaning of Cakkhu Vinnana is 'the Citta arising in the eye'. By it, the seeing of the form that has come
        before the eye is performed.</p>
      <p>The meaning of Sota Vinnana is 'the Citta arising in the ear'. By it, the hearing of sounds coming to the ear
        is performed.</p>
      <p>The meaning of Ghana Vinnana is 'the Citta arising in the nose'. By it, the smelling of odors coming to the
        nose is performed.</p>
      <p>The meaning of Kaya Vinnana is 'the Citta arising in the body'. By it, the touches occurring on the body are
        known.</p>
      <p>The Citta that accepts the object taken by the five consciousnesses such as Eye Consciousness is called the
        Sampaticchana Citta.</p>
      <p>The Citta that investigates the object taken by Sampaticchana is called Santirana. (The nature of Sampaticchana
        and Santirana Cittas can be known in the Vithi section. For now, remember only the number of Cittas.)</p>
      <p><a id="_Toc503740005"></a><b>The Eight Ahetuka Kusala Vipaka Cittas</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Upekkha-sahagata Cakkhu Vinnana</b></li>
        <li><b>Upekkha-sahagata Sota Vinnana</b></li>
        <li><b>Upekkha-sahagata Ghana Vinnana</b></li>
        <li><b>Upekkha-sahagata Jivha Vinnana</b></li>
        <li><b>Sukha-sahagata Kaya Vinnana (Body Consciousness associated with Pleasure)</b></li>
        <li><b>Upekkha-sahagata Sampaticchana</b></li>
        <li><b>Somanassa-sahagata Santirana (Investigating Consciousness associated with Joy)</b></li>
        <li><b>Upekkha-sahagata Santirana</b></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Thus, there are eight Ahetuka Kusala Vipaka Cittas.</p>
      <p>Akusala Cittas produce only Ahetuka Vipaka. Kusala Cittas produce both Ahetuka and Sahetuka Vipaka. What has
        been stated are the Ahetuka Vipaka Cittas produced by Kusala. The Sahetuka Vipaka produced by Kusala can be
        known later. <b>It should also be remembered that there are only Ahetuka Kusala Vipaka Cittas, and there is no
          group of Ahetuka Kusala Cittas.</b></p>
      <p>The difference in Ahetuka Kusala Vipaka compared to Akusala Vipaka is that the Kaya Vinnana is Sukha-sahagata
        (associated with pleasure), and there are two Santiranas.</p>
      <p>There are two Santiranas according to the objects. When the object is very good, the Santirana is
        Somanassa-sahagata. When the object is medium, it is Upekkha-sahagata.</p>
      <p><b>Questions</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Are these Cittas called Ahetuka Cittas because they arise automatically? Or due to another reason?</li>
        <li>What are the Dhammas called Hetu?</li>
        <li>To what kind of group of Cittas is the name Vipaka used?</li>
        <li>How are names given to Ahetuka Cittas?</li>
        <li>Do Akusala Cittas produce Sahetuka Vipaka as well?</li>
        <li>What are the differences in Kusala Vipaka Cittas compared to Akusala Vipaka Cittas?</li>
