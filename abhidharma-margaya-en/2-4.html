      </div>
      <p>It was stated above that there are four Paramartha Dharmas: Citta - Cetasika - Rupa - Nirvana.</p>
      <p>Of those four, Citta should be learned first. Citta is generally one. However, Abhidharma cannot be taught by
        taking it as one. In order to teach the nature of Citta, in this Dhamma it is divided into eighty-nine (89) in
        one method, and one hundred and twenty-one (121) in another method. Citta is divided by Bhumi (Plane), Jati
        (Nature) etc. </p>
      <p><b>The Four Divisions of Citta such as Kamavacara</b></p>
      <p>The Citta which is generally one is divided into four based on Bhumis as <b>Kamavacara</b> Citta,
        <b>Rupavacara</b> Citta, <b>Arupavacara</b> Citta, and <b>Lokottara</b> Citta.
      </p>
      <p>The eleven planes comprising the four Apayas (Woeful States), the human world, and the six heavens are called
        Kama Bhumi (Sensuous Plane). The Citta belonging to the Kama Bhumi is called Kamavacara because it mostly arises
        in that eleven-fold Kama Bhumi.</p>
      <p>The Citta belonging to the Rupa Bhumi is called Rupavacara because it mostly arises in the fifteen-fold Rupa
        Bhumi (Fine Material Plane).</p>
      <p>The Citta belonging to the Arupa Bhumi is called Arupavacara because it mostly arises in the four Arupa Bhumis
        (Immaterial Plane).</p>
      <p>Although a Lokottara Bhumi is mentioned, there is no place called Lokottara Bhumi. In this analysis of Citta,
        the Lokottara Dharmas themselves are called the Lokottara Bhumi. The Citta belonging to the Lokottara Bhumi,
        which does not belong to the mentioned three planes, is called Lokottara.</p>
      <p>Some Kamavacara Cittas arise in Rupa and Arupa Bhumis as well. Similarly, some Rupavacara and Arupavacara
        Cittas arise in the Kamavacara Bhumi as well. These Cittas are given names like Kamavacara considering that they
        mostly arise in those respective planes. Even when a Kamavacara Citta arises in Rupa or Arupa Bhumis, it is
        still called by the name Kamavacara. Even when Rupavacara and Arupavacara Cittas arise in the Kama Bhumi, they
        are called by the names Rupavacara and Arupavacara. Lokottara Cittas also arise in all three planes: Kama, Rupa,
        and Arupa. However, since those Cittas do not belong to those planes, they are referred to by the name Lokottara
        itself.</p>
      <p>The meaning of Kamavacara Citta is the Citta that mostly arises in the Kama Loka (Sensuous World).</p>
      <p>The meaning of Rupavacara Citta is the Citta that mostly arises in the Rupa Loka (Fine Material World).</p>
      <p>The meaning of Arupavacara Citta is the Citta that mostly arises in the Arupa Loka (Immaterial World).</p>
      <p>The meaning of Lokottara Citta is the Citta that transcends the world and stands beyond the world.</p>
      <p>Kamavacara and other Cittas are divided by other methods as well. The methods of division will be known in
        those respective places. When divided thus, there are fifty-four (54) Kamavacara Cittas. There are fifteen (15)
        Rupavacara Cittas. There are twelve (12) Arupavacara Cittas. Lokottara Cittas are eight (8) in the brief method,
        and forty (40) in the detailed method. When all are added together, there are eighty-nine (89) in the brief
        method. In the detailed method, there are one hundred and twenty-one (121).</p>
