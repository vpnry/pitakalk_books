      <p>All Rupas are <b>Ahetuka</b> because they are devoid of roots like Lobha etc. They are called <b>Sappaccaya</b>
        because they arise from causes like Kamma etc. They are called <b>Sasava</b> because they are objects for
        Asavas. They are called <b>Sankhata</b> because they are produced by causes like Kamma etc. They are called
        <b>Laukika</b> because they belong to the world. They are called <b>Kamavacara</b> because they are objects for
        sensual craving. They are called <b>Anarammana</b> because they do not take objects. They are called
        <b>Appahatabba</b> because they are not to be abandoned like defilements.
      </p>
      <p>The five Prasada Rupas are called <b>Ajjhattika Rupas</b>. The remaining twenty-three Rupas are called
        <b>Bahira Rupas</b>.
      </p>
      <p>Generally, all Rupas belonging to the body of a being are called Ajjhattika Rupas because they are regarded as
        self, saying 'mine', 'I'. Among the group of Rupas belonging to the self-state, the five Prasada Rupas are
        specially given the name Ajjhattika because the regard as self and craving towards them exist excessively.</p>
      <p>The six Rupas namely five Prasada Rupas and Hadaya Rupa are called <b>Vatthu Rupas</b>. The remaining
        twenty-two Rupas are called <b>Avatthu Rupas</b>. The name Vatthu Rupa is given to six Rupas because they are
        bases for consciousnesses.</p>
      <p>The seven Rupas namely five Prasada Rupas and two Vinnatti Rupas are called <b>Dvara Rupas</b>. The remaining
        twenty-one Rupas are called <b>Advara Rupas</b>. The five Prasada Rupas are doors for the five consciousnesses.
        The two Vinnatti Rupas are doors for bodily and verbal actions.</p>
      <p>The eight Rupas namely five Prasada Rupas, two Bhava Rupas, and Jivita Rupa are called <b>Indriya Rupas</b>.
        The remaining twenty Rupas are called <b>Anindriya Rupas</b>. Indriya refers to Dhammas that exercise lordship
        over something. The five Prasada Rupas exercise lordship over the five consciousnesses. The five consciousnesses
        arise in conformity with the Prasadas. The two Bhava Rupas exercise lordship over other Rupas by imparting
        female and male natures.</p>
      <p>The twelve Rupas namely five Prasada Rupas and seven Gocara Rupas are <b>Olarika Rupas</b>. Also <b>Santike
          Rupas</b>. Also <b>Sappatigha Rupas</b>. The sixteen Rupas namely Apo Dhatu, Stri Bhava, Purusa Bhava, Hadaya
        Rupa, Jivita Rupa, Ahara Rupa, Pariccheda Rupa, five Vikara Rupas, and four Laksana Rupas are <b>Sukhuma
          Rupas</b>. Also <b>Dure Rupas</b>. Also <b>Appatigha Rupas</b>.</p>
      <p>It was said 'seven Gocara Rupas' because Sprastavya consists of three Rupas: Pathavi, Tejo, Vayo.</p>
      <p>Prasada Rupas and Visaya Rupas are Olarika because they strike each other. They are called Olarika because they
        are not subtle. The meaning of the word Santike Rupa is 'Rupas that are near'. Since Prasada Rupas and Gocara
        Rupas are gross, they can be easily known. Therefore, even if they are far, they are like being near. That is
        why they are given the name Santike Rupa. They are given the name Sappatigha Rupa because they strike each
        other.</p>
      <p>The eighteen Rupas produced by Kamma are called <b>Upadinna Rupas</b>. The remaining ten Rupas are called
        <b>Anupadinna</b>. Which Rupas are produced by Kamma will be known later. The meaning of the word Upadinna is
        'that which is grasped by craving and views as mine and I'. All bodily Rupas are grasped by craving and views as
        mine and I. Since Kammaja Rupas are the main part of the Rupa body, that grasping is stronger in Kammaja Rupas.
        Therefore, they are specially given the name Upadinna.
      </p>
      <p>The first of the Gocara Rupas, Varna Rupa, is called <b>Sanidassana</b> <b>Rupa</b>. Its meaning is 'visible
        Rupa'. Of the twenty-eight Rupas, only Varna Rupa is seen by the eye. The other twenty-seven Rupas are called
        <b>Anidassana Rupas</b> because they are not seen.
      </p>
      <p>The five Prasada Rupas are called <b>Gocaraggahika Rupas</b> because they take objects like Rupa etc. The
        remaining twenty-three Rupas are called <b>Agocaraggahika</b> because they do not take objects.</p>
      <p>Among Prasada Rupas, Cakkhu and Sota are called <b>Asampattaggahaka</b> because they take only objects that are
        far. Only a thing that is far and strikes the eye is seen by the eye. If something strikes and stays in the eye
        itself, it is not seen by the eye. The eyelid is not seen because it stays striking the eye. Sound heard by the
        ear is also the sound that is far. That is why the listener feels the direction and place of the sound.
        Ghana-Jivha-Kaya Prasadas are not capable of taking objects situated far.</p>
      <p>The eight Rupas namely four: Varna-Gandha-Rasa-Oja, and four Bhuta Rupas are called <b>Avinibbhoga Rupas</b>
        because they are not inseparable from each other. The remaining twenty Rupas are called <b>Vinibbhoga Rupas</b>.
