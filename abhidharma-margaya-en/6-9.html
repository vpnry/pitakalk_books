      </div>
      <p>Patisandhi in Kama Sugati is produced by Kamavacara Kusala. During the Pavatti Kala, all sixteen Cittas: the
        eight Maha Vipakas and the eight Ahetuka Kusala Vipakas are produced in both Kama and Rupa worlds as
        appropriate.</p>
      <p>Kamavacara Kusala is twofold as Tihetuka Kusala and Dvihetuka Kusala. The four Nana Samprayukta Cittas are
        Tihetuka. The four Nana Viprayukta Cittas are Dvihetuka. Of them, Tihetuka Kusala is powerful. Dvihetuka Kusala
        is weak. Tihetuka Kusala is also twofold as Utkrsta (Superior) and Omaka (Inferior). Dvihetuka Kusala is also
        twofold in the same way.</p>
      <p>If one does a Kusala with the expectation of appearing as a superior person among people or with the intention
        of humiliating others, that Kusala becomes inferior because the intention is impure. If Akusala Cittas arise
        close to the time of doing the Kusala and after doing the Kusala, the Kusala becomes inferior due to the
        Akusalas arisen on both sides. If one becomes dissatisfied with the Kusala done, thinking "I did a foolish
        thing" after doing the Kusala, by that also the Kusala becomes inferior. Omaka Kusala refers to inferior Kusala.
        The Kusala that is not defiled by self-exaltation or disparaging others, or by defilements arising before and
        after, and which is rejoiced repeatedly even after doing it thinking "I have done a good thing" is Utkrsta
        Kusala.</p>
      <p>Tihetuka Utkrsta Kusala gives Tihetuka Patisandhi and produces sixteen Vipakas during Pavatti Kala: eight Maha
        Vipakas and eight Ahetuka Kusala Vipakas. By each of the four Tihetuka Utkrsta Kusala Cittas, Patisandhi in Kama
        Sugati is given in this way and sixteen Vipakas are produced during Pavatti Kala. Producing these sixteen Vipaka
        Cittas is not done all at once, but is done on various occasions as pleasant forms, sounds etc. are met.</p>
      <p>The Somanassa Sahagata or Upekkha Sahagata nature and Asankharika or Sasankharika nature of a Kusala are not
        factors that influence the giving of results. Therefore, it should be noted that Upekkha Sahagata Vipaka can
        arise from Somanassa Sahagata Kusala, Somanassa Sahagata Vipaka from Upekkha Sahagata Kusala, Sasankharika
        Vipaka from Asankharika Kusala, and Asankharika Vipaka from Sasankharika Kusala.</p>
      <p>Tihetuka Omaka Kusala and Dvihetuka Utkrsta Kusala give Dvihetuka Patisandhi, and produce twelve Vipakas during
        Pavatti Kala: four Nana Vippayutta Maha Vipakas and eight Ahetuka Kusala Vipakas.</p>
      <p>Dvihetuka Omaka Kusala gives Ahetuka Patisandhi and produces only eight Ahetuka Kusala Vipakas during Pavatti
        Kala.</p>
      <p>There is also a teacher's view that "Sasankharika Vipaka does not arise from Asankharika Kusala and Asankharika
        Vipaka does not arise from Sasankharika Kusala". It is not accepted by many teachers. The Asankharika or
        Sasankharika nature of Cittas is not due to past Kamma, but happens according to the conditions present at the
        time of the arising of those Cittas.</p>
      <p><b>Results of Rupavacara Kusala</b></p>
      <p>Rupavacara Kusala is also threefold as Paritta (Minor), Madhyama (Medium), and Pranita (Superior). Rupavacara
        Kusala associated with weak Chanda etc. is Paritta. Kusala associated with medium Chanda etc. is Madhyama.
        Kusala associated with superior Chanda etc. is Pranita Kusala.</p>
      <p>Kamavacara Kusala is a weak Citta. Therefore, many Vipaka Cittas similar and dissimilar to it are produced by
        it in various places. Rupavacara Kusala is a powerful Citta. Therefore, low Vipaka Cittas dissimilar to it are
        not produced by it. Results are produced by it only in the Brahma state which is a high place. Even in the
        Brahma state, only Jhana Cittas similar to the Kusala are produced by it as Patisandhi, Bhavanga, and Cuti, and
        no other Citta is produced.</p>
      <p>By Paritta Rupavacara First Jhana Kusala, they are born in Brahmaparisajja. By Madhyama First Jhana Kusala,
        they are born in Brahmapurohita. By Pranita First Jhana, they are born in Maha Brahma.</p>
      <p>By Paritta Second and Third Jhana Kusalas, they are born in Parittabha. By Madhyama Kusalas, in Appamanabha. By
        Pranita Kusalas, in Abhassara.</p>
      <p>By Paritta Fourth Jhana, they are born in Parittasubha. By Madhyama, in Appamanasubha. By Pranita, in
        Subhakinha.</p>
      <p>By Fifth Jhana, they are born in Vehapphala. By developing the Fifth Jhana itself as Sanna Viraga (dispassion
        towards perception), they are born among Asanna beings. Some sectarian Kamma proponents, seeing the fault in the
        mind thinking "When there is a mind, there are attachments, conflicts, and delusions; when there is no mind,
        they are not there", wish for a mindless existence, develop the Fifth Jhana by Vayo Kasina meditation and are
        born in Asanna Bhava. They are born there in the posture they died.</p>
      <p>Anagamis who have attained Fifth Jhana are born in Suddhavasa. Others are not born in Suddhavasa. Of the
        Anagamis, those with excessive Saddha are born in Aviha, those with excessive Virya in Atappa, those with
        excessive Smrti in Sudassa, those with excessive Samadhi in Sudassi, and those with excessive Panna in
        Akanittha.</p>
      <p>Arupa Jhana attainers are born in Akasanancayatanadi Bhumis in order.</p>
