      <p>There are twenty-two Indriyas namely <b>Cakkhundriya Sotindriya Ghanindriya Jivhindriya Kayindriya Itthindriya
          Purisindriya Jivitindriya Manindriya Sukhindriya Dukkhindriya Somanassindriya Domanassindriya Upekkhindriya
          Saddhindriya Viriyindriya Satindriya Samadhindriya Pannindriya Anannatannassamitindriya Annindriya
          Annatavindriya</b>.</p>
      <p>Dhammas which exercise dominance over associated Dhammas are called Indriya. Exercising dominance means making
        them conform to oneself. The said Cakkhu etc. Dhammas are called "Indriya" because they exercise dominance over
        associated Dhammas.</p>
      <p>Cakkhundriya is the Cakkhu Prasada Rupa. It is dominant over Cakkhu Vinnana. Cakkhu Vinnana can arise only
        according to Cakkhu Prasada. When Cakkhu Prasada is very bright, a Cakkhu Vinnana arises which sees the form
        well according to it. If the brightness of Cakkhu Prasada decreases, a Cakkhu Vinnana arises which does not see
        the object well according to it. When there are defects in the eye, objects appear small or large or with
        changed color not as they are, because Cakkhu Vinnana arises conforming to Cakkhu Prasada. Cakkhu Vinnana cannot
        arise surpassing the nature of Cakkhu Prasada without conforming to it. Cakkhu Prasada is an Indriya because it
        makes Cakkhu Vinnana conform to itself.</p>
      <p>Sotindriya is the Sota Prasada.</p>
      <p>Ghanindriya is the Ghana Prasada.</p>
      <p>Jivhindriya is the Jivha Prasada.</p>
      <p>Kayindriya is the Kaya Prasada.</p>
      <p>These four Indriyas also exercise dominance over Sota - Ghana - Jivha - Kaya Vinnanas respectively.</p>
      <p>Itthindriya is the female Bhava Rupa.</p>
      <p>Purisindriya is the male Bhava Rupa.</p>
      <p>Bhava Rupa exercises dominance over the entire form by imparting female appearance and male appearance. There
        is a difference in the ideas and thoughts of men and women. The cause for that is also the two male and female
        natures. Therefore, it should be said that Bhava Rupas have dominance over the Pancaskandha in general.</p>
      <p>Jivitindriya is twofold as Rupa - Arupa. Jivitindriya Rupa is Rupa Jivitindriya. Jivitindriya Cetasika is Arupa
        Jivitindriya. Jivitindriya Rupa exercises dominance over Kammaja Rupas, and Jivitindriya Cetasika exercises
        dominance over Citta Cetasikas. That exercising of dominance is regarding maintaining the continuity for a long
        time.</p>
      <p>Manindriya is the Citta. Citta exercises dominance over Dhammas arising together with itself regarding
        cognizing the object.</p>
      <p>Sukhindriya - Dukkhindriya - Somanassindriya - Domanassindriya - Upekkhindriya, these five are the single
        Vedana Cetasika by way of Dhamma. The single Vedana Cetasika comes to the division as Sukhindriya etc. by the
        mode of experiencing the taste of the object. Sukha - Domanassa two Vedanas experience the taste of the object
        in a desirable way. Dukkha Domanassa two Vedanas experience the taste of the object in an undesirable way.
        Upekkha Vedana experiences the taste of the object in a neutral way. Sukha Vedana etc. exercise dominance over
        associated Dhammas in experiencing the taste of the object in those respective ways. 'Associated Dhammas' refers
        to Citta Cetasikas arising bound with those respective Vedanas.</p>
      <p>Saddhindriya is the Saddha Cetasika. </p>
      <p>Viriyindriya is the Viriya Cetasika.</p>
      <p>Satindriya is the Sati Cetasika.</p>
      <p>Samadhindriya is the Ekaggata Cetasika.</p>
      <p>(Except the Ekaggata in Vicikiccha-sahagata Citta.)</p>
      <p>Pannindriya is the Panna in mundane Cittas.</p>
      <p>Out of these five Dhammas, 'Saddha' is dominant over associated Dhammas regarding placing confidence in objects
        like Buddha. 'Viriya' exercises dominance over associated Dhammas regarding not retreating in action, 'Sati'
        regarding not letting what should be done pass away, 'Samadhi' regarding establishing well in the object,
        'Panna' regarding knowing the nature of the object.</p>
      <p>'Anannatannassamitindriya' is the Panna of the Sotapatti Magga Citta. The meaning of the word
        'Anannatannassamitindriya' is 'the Indriya of the one who strives thinking I will know what has not been known'.
        Since it is the knowledge arising due to that effort in the one practicing Vipassana with the effort 'I will
        know the Four Truths Dhamma or Nibbana which was not known at any time before', the first Magga Nana is called
        Anannatannassamitindriya.</p>
      <p>'Annindriya' is the Panna in the six Lokuttara Cittas from Sotapatti Phala Citta up to Arahat Magga Citta. The
        meaning of the word Annindriya is 'the knowing Indriya'. Although what was not known before was known by
        Sotapatti Magga Nana, since the function of eradicating Kilesas is not finished, what was known once is seen
        again and again by these six Nanas.</p>
      <p>'Annatavindriya' is the Panna of the Arahat Phala Citta. The meaning of Annatavindriya is 'the Indriya of the
        one who has finished knowing what should be known'.</p>
      <p>Thus, although there are twenty-two Indriyas, when taken by way of Dhammas, since the five Vedana Indriyas are
        the single Vedana Cetasika, and the four final Indriyas starting with Pannindriya are the single Panna Cetasika,
        and the single Jivitindriya becomes two Dhammas as Rupa-Arupa, there are sixteen Indriyas by way of Dhammas.</p>
      <p>The sixteen Dhammas namely five Prasada Rupas, two Bhava Rupas, Jivita Rupa, Jivitindriya Cetasika, Citta,
        Vedana, five Cetasikas Saddha - Viriya - Sati - Ekaggata - Panna are Indriya Dhammas.</p>
      <p><b>Benefit of Knowing Indriyas</b></p>
      <p>Those who do not know Paramartha Dhammas, who do not have knowledge about their power, wrongly understand the
        work done by Indriyas as "work done by a soul existing inside". They wrongly think "Indriyas themselves are the
        soul". Understanding Indriya Dhammas helps to understand that there is no soul considered by the world as
        existing. The Tathagata has preached these twenty-two Indriyas to liberate the multitude of people who are
        deluded thinking there is a soul.</p>
