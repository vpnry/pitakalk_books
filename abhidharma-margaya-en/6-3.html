      <p>There are four types of Patisandhi (Rebirth): Apaya Patisandhi, Kama Sugati Patisandhi, Rupavacara Patisandhi,
        and Arupavacara Patisandhi.</p>
      <p>There is one Apaya Patisandhi. That is: the Akusala Vipaka Upekkha Sahagata Santirana Citta. For a being who
        has perceived an Akusala Kamma, or an Akusala Kamma Nimitta, or an Apaya Gati Nimitta at the time of death,
        simultaneously with the cessation of the Cuti Citta which is the last mind of the present existence, the Akusala
        Vipaka Upekkha Sahagata Santirana Citta arises in the Apaya Bhumi taking the object perceived at the time of
        death as its object. The arising of that mind itself is the birth of that being in Apaya. It is the going to
        Apaya. Because of that Citta which arose belonging to the same series of minds of the dying being immediately
        after the Cuti Citta, the past existence and the present Apaya existence are connected. Therefore, that mind is
        called the Patisandhi Citta. After that, that Upekkha Sahagata Santirana Citta which arose at Patisandhi starts
        to arise repeatedly so that the series of minds belonging to that Apaya existence is not broken. When it arises
        like that, it is called the Bhavanga Citta. The mind that arises as the last mind of the existence is also that
        same mind. Thus, for beings born in the Apaya Bhumi, the Akusala Vipakopekkhasahagata Santirana Citta exists as
        Patisandhi, Bhavanga, and Cuti. <b>For one being in one existence, the Patisandhi Citta, the Bhavanga Citta, and
          the Cuti Citta are one and the same mind.</b></p>
      <p>There are nine Kama Sugati Patisandhis. The Kusala Vipakopekkhasahagata Santirana and the eight Maha Vipakas
        are these nine Kama Sugati Patisandhi Cittas.</p>
      <p>For certain inferior humans such as those born blind, and for certain Vinipatika Asuras who associate with
        earth-bound deities, the Kusala Vipaka Upekkha Sahagata Santirana becomes the Patisandhi. This Kusala Vipaka
        Upekkha Sahagata Santirana arises as the result of a very weak Kusala.</p>
      <p>Beings who are conceived in the human world with the Kusala Vipaka Upekkha Sahagata Santirana are those who are
        blind from birth, deaf, dumb, Aghanakas (those without a sense of smell), Kelatolu (drooling idiots), mad,
        Pandakas, Ubhatobyanjanakas (hermaphrodites), Napumsakas (neutrals), and Mammas (stammerers).</p>
      <p>Aghanakas are those without the olfactory organ. Kelatolus are fools who do not even know left and right. Since
        they do not have enough knowledge even to keep saliva in their mouth, saliva drools from their mouth. Therefore
        they are called Kelatolu. Pandakas are those who have abnormalities regarding sexual characteristics.
        Ubhatobyanjanakas are those who have both male and female sexual organs. Napumsakas are those who have no sexual
        characteristics. Mammas are those who speak by saying one letter two or three times with great effort.</p>
      <p>Vinipatika Asuras are a group of beings who live with difficulty in uninhabited places like trees, rocks,
        caves, cemeteries, forests etc., having no dwelling place obtained by their own merit. They are also called
        Yakkhas. They go to cities and villages and find and eat rice, curry etc. thrown away by people. Sometimes they
        trouble infants, patients, and other weak people to obtain food and drink. They are the ones who accept the
        offerings given by exorcists (Kattadi). Not all Vinipatika Asuras are Ahetuka Patisandhikas. There are Dvihetuka
        and Trihetuka ones among them too. The Trihetuka ones among them sometimes even attain Paths and Fruits.
        Commentaries state that Yakkhas like Piyankaramata and Punabbasumata belonging to Vinipatika Asuras listened to
        the Dhamma and attained the fruit of Sovan. It is said that certain Petas like Paradattupajivika and Yakkhas are
        also included in this group.</p>
      <p>The eight Maha Vipaka Cittas exist as Patisandhi, Bhavanga, and Cuti in the seven Kama Sugati Bhumis.</p>
      <p>The Akusala Vipaka Upekkha Sahagata Santirana, the Kusala Vipaka Upekkha Sahagata Santirana, and the eight Maha
        Vipakas - these ten minds are Kamavacara Patisandhi Cittas.</p>
      <p><b>Lifespan of Kama Beings</b></p>
      <p>Among Kama beings, there is no fixed lifespan for beings in the four Apayas, humans, and Vinipatika Asuras.</p>
      <p>The lifespan in Caturmaharajika is 500 celestial years. Fifty years in the human world is one day in
        Caturmaharajika. Thirty such days make a month. Twelve such months make a year. Five hundred years there are
        calculated by those years. Those five hundred years are 9,000,000 (ninety lakhs) years in human calculation.</p>
      <p>The lifespan in Tavatimsa is four times that of Caturmaharajika. Thus, up to Parinirmitavashavarti Deva world,
        the lifespan of Deva worlds increases four times each.</p>
      <p>The lifespan in Tavatimsa is 1000 years by its calculation. One hundred years in the human world is one day
        there. In human years, the lifespan in Tavatimsa is 36,000,000 (three crores sixty lakhs) years.</p>
      <p>The lifespan in Yama is 2000 years by its calculation. Two hundred of our years is one day there. By our
        calculation, the lifespan there is 144,000,000 (fourteen crores forty lakhs) years.</p>
      <p>The lifespan of Tushita Devas is 4000 years by its calculation. Four hundred of our years is one day there. By
        our calculation, the lifespan there is 576,000,000 (fifty-seven crores sixty lakhs) years.</p>
      <p>The lifespan of Nirmanarati Devas is 8000 years by its calculation. Eight hundred of our years is one day
        there. By our calculation, the lifespan there is 2,304,000,000 (two hundred thirty crores forty lakhs) years.
      </p>
      <p>The lifespan of Parinirmitavashavarti Devas is 16,000 years by its calculation. One thousand six hundred of our
        years is one day there. By our years, the lifespan there is 9,216,000,000 (nine hundred twenty-one crores sixty
        lakhs) years.</p>
