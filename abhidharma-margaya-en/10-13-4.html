      <p>The knowledge that knows the causes of arising of Nama and Rupa, removing doubts such as "How did these Nama
        and Rupa arise? Did these exist in the past as well? Will they arise in the future?", is called
        <b>Kankhavitarana Visuddhi</b>.
      </p>
      <p>The yogi who has developed Ditthi Visuddhi by finding the true nature of Nama and Rupa, now has to search for
        the conditions of Nama and Rupa to develop Kankhavitarana Visuddhi. It can be done briefly or in detail.
        Considering that Nama such as Cakkhuvinnana arise due to bases such as eye and objects such as form, and Rupas
        arise due to Citta, Utu, and Ahara, and both Nama and Rupa arise due to Avijja, Tanha, Upadana, and Kamma, is
        considering the conditions of Nama and Rupa briefly. The Paticcasamuppada method shown in the eighth chapter
        here is the detailed method of considering conditions. Beginners should not go to search for conditions by the
        Patthana method. It is beyond their scope.</p>
      <p>For the yogi who examines the conditions of Nama and Rupa, by seeing that the group of Nama and Rupa dhammas
        arises completely from conditions, the Ahetuka Ditthi is abandoned. By seeing that those respective Nama and
        Rupa dhammas arise only due to appropriate causes and not in any other way, the Visama Hetu Ditthi such as
        "These Nama and Rupa are created by God, created by Time" is also abandoned. The view that there is a doer of
        Kamma and an experiencer of result other than Nama and Rupa is also abandoned. By seeing the arising of the two
        Nama and Rupa as a succession of cause and effect in the beginningless Samsara, doubts such as "Did I exist in
        the past? Will I arise in the future?" are removed. By seeing that the Buddha's teaching is true, the doubt
        arising regarding the eight places such as the Buddha is removed.</p>
