      </div>
      <p><b>Moha, Ahirika, Anottappa, Uddhacca, Lobha, Ditthi, Mana, Dosa, Issa, Macchariya, Kukkucca, Thina, Middha,
          and Vicikiccha</b> are the fourteen Akusala Cetasikas.</p>
      <p><b>Moha</b></p>
      <p>The nature of covering the true state of the object is called Moha. It should be said that Moha is like a film
        on the eye, and like darkness. Because of this, suffering appears to beings as sweetness, as happiness. Tanha,
        which is the cause of arising of suffering, appears as a cause of happiness. The true happiness which is the
        cessation of suffering appears as an evil. The true path to attain happiness appears as suffering. Therefore,
        not knowing suffering, not knowing the cause of arising of suffering, not knowing the true happiness which is
        the cessation of suffering, not knowing the path leading to true happiness; these are called Moha. What is
        called Avijja is also this Moha.</p>
      <p><b>Ahirika</b></p>
      <p>The nature of not loathing sin is called Ahirika. This is also called the nature of not being ashamed of sin.
      </p>
      <p><b>Anottappa</b></p>
      <p>The nature of not fearing sin is called Anottappa. These two Cetasikas, Ahirika and Anottappa, are two great
        powers in the Akusala side.</p>
      <p><b>Uddhacca</b></p>
      <p>The nature of the mind shaking, the nature of not standing well on the object is called Uddhacca. This is a
        nature opposed to Samadhi.</p>
      <p><b>Lobha</b></p>
      <p>The nature of taking the object as a good thing and clinging to it is called Lobha. It should also be called
        the nature of adhering to the object. The words Raga, Pema, Alaya, Adara, Asha, Onakama (want) also refer to
        Lobha itself.</p>
      <p><b>Ditthi</b></p>
      <p>The nature of seeing wrongly, the nature of taking the matter incorrectly is called Ditthi. The nature of
        seeing what exists as not existing, what does not exist as existing, what happened as not happened, what happens
        as not happening, good thing as bad thing, bad thing as good thing, thing with good result as thing with bad
        result, thing with bad result as thing with good result, is the nature of seeing wrongly. Ditthi is twofold as
        Samma Ditthi and Miccha Ditthi. Samma Ditthi is the wisdom seeing the matter as it is. Miccha Ditthi is the
        nature of seeing wrongly. In these Akusala Cetasikas, what is indicated by the name Ditthi is Miccha Ditthi.</p>
      <p><b>Mana</b></p>
      <p>The nature of measuring one's own status by oneself as "I am a certain high person in the world" etc. is called
        Mana. Mana is threefold as Seyya Mana, Sadisa Mana, Hina Mana. The Mana arising as "I am higher than others" is
        called "Seyya Mana". The Mana arising as "I am equal to others" is called "Sadisa Mana". The Mana arising as "I
        am lower than others" is called "Hina Mana". It is said that this Mana should be known as a madness.</p>
      <p><b>Dosa</b></p>
      <p>The nature opposed to the object is Dosa. Dvesha is also a name for it. It generally has the characteristic of
        wickedness and roughness. It arises in several ways. What are referred to by names Krodha (anger), Kopa (wrath),
        Bhaya (fear), Nosatuta (dissatisfaction), Pilikula (disgust), Aprasada (displeasure) are Dosa arising in those
        respective ways. Shoka (sorrow) is also something arising with Dosa.</p>
      <p><b>Issa</b></p>
      <p>The nature opposed to others' happiness, others' prosperity is called Issa. Irshya (jealousy) is also a name
        for it.</p>
      <p><b>Macchariya</b></p>
      <p>The nature of not tolerating one's own thing belonging to another, not tolerating another benefiting from one's
        own thing, not tolerating another receiving a prosperity like one's own prosperity, and hiding one's own
        prosperity is called Macchariya. Matsarya is also a name for it.</p>
      <p>(It is stated in Dhammasangani that there are five Macchariyas: Avasa Macchariya, Kula Macchariya, Labha
        Macchariya, Vanna Macchariya, Dhamma Macchariya.)</p>
      <p><b>Kukkucca</b></p>
      <p>The nature of repenting about committed sins and uncommitted merits is called Kukkucca.</p>
      <p><b>Thina and Middha</b></p>
      <p>The weakness of the mind, the inferiority of the mental impulse, the lethargy of the mind is called Thina. The
        weakness, the lethargy of Cetasikas is called Middha. By the arising of Thina Middha, the mind shrinks. Viriya
        decreases. Sometimes sleepiness also occurs.</p>
      <p><b>Vicikiccha</b></p>
      <p>The doubt regarding the object, the lack of confidence is called Vicikiccha. This is a Cetasika opposed to
        Saddha and also to Nana. In this discussion of Akusala, what is meant by Vicikiccha are generally doubts that
        are hindrances to all Kusalas and especially to high Dhammas like Jhana. Doubt arises in anyone about unknown
        things as "is it like this or like that". That is not this Vicikiccha Cetasika. Akusala Vicikiccha are doubting
        about the Buddha, doubting about the Dhamma etc. </p>
