      <p><b>10th Lesson</b></p>
      <p><b>Dukkha Arya Satya, Dukkha Samudaya Arya Satya, Dukkha Nirodha Arya Satya, Dukkha Nirodhagamini Patipada Arya
          Satya</b> are the four Arya Satyas.</p>
      <p>Truth (Satya) is what definitely exists, exists exactly in that way and not in any other way. These truths are
        named Arya Satya by adding the word Arya to the beginning not just by saying Satya, for several reasons. Some
        truths are true in one way but become untrue when looked at in another way. There is no becoming untrue in any
        way in the four truths such as Dukkha etc. preached by the Buddha. They are exactly so. The truth that does not
        change in any way is the noble truth among truths. Here the word Arya is added to the beginning of the word
        Satya to show the nobility of these truths. The noble truth is called Arya Satya.</p>
      <p>These four truths were preached by the Buddha. The Buddha is called Arya because he is worshipped by the world
        including Devas. Since these are things seen and preached to the world by the Arya Buddha, these truths belong
        to the Buddha. In the sense that they are the truths of the Arya, they are called Arya Satyas.</p>
      <p>If one realizes these four truths, that person transcends the state of Puthujjana and reaches the state of Arya
        Puggala. Since they cause the person who realizes them to reach the Arya state, these truths are also called
        Arya Satya.</p>
      <p><b>Dukkha Arya Satya</b></p>
      <p>The eighty-one Lokiya Cittas, the fifty-one Cetasikas other than Lobha, and the twenty-eight Rupas - this group
        of Dhammas belongs to Dukkha Satya.</p>
      <p>The suffering of birth, the suffering of decay, the suffering of death, the suffering of having to sorrow and
        weep due to loss of relatives etc., the suffering of excessive mental fatigue due to loss of relatives etc., the
        suffering of association with the unpleasant, the suffering of separation from the pleasant, the suffering of
        not getting what one wants - all these arise and have as their object the group of Dhammas said to belong to
        Dukkha Satya. Among those Dhammas, there is not a single Dhamma that is free from these three: Jati, Jara,
        Marana. Therefore, that group of Dhammas is definitely suffering (Dukkha). Because they are definitely
        suffering, they are called Dukkha Satya.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, because the person who is attached to that mass of Sankhara Dhammas called Dukkha Satya is
        afflicted by the three sufferings namely Sankhara Dukkha, Viparinama Dukkha, and Dukkha Dukkha, those Dhammas
        are definitely suffering.</p>
      <p>Of those three sufferings, Sankhara Dukkha is the suffering that arises regarding producing something first and
        maintaining it. To be born as a human in the human world, there must be some merit. Without merit, a human
        Pancaskandha cannot be obtained. Therefore, the one who wishes to obtain it must do merit for it. Having to do
        merit is one suffering that arises regarding the human Pancaskandha. Even if merit is done, if many sins are
        committed, it is not obtained. Therefore, one must refrain from sins. Refraining from sins is also not an easy
        task. Having to refrain from sins is also one suffering regarding producing the human Pancaskandha. After being
        born in the human world, human life is not protected automatically. One has to strive hard to provide food and
        drink and to protect it without letting it perish. That striving is the suffering regarding maintaining life
        after birth. All that is the Sankhara Dukkha produced by the human Pancaskandha.</p>
      <p>Viparinama Dukkha is the suffering caused by the decay and breaking up of the arisen Sankharas. However this
        human Pancaskandha is nourished, it changes by decaying. It can be destroyed by not receiving food etc. as
        needed or by not receiving requisites as needed or by some other danger or by coming to death. By the exhaustion
        of life span, it will definitely come to death someday and be completely destroyed. It cannot be prevented by
        any power. When one sees causes such as diseases by which Pancaskandha can be destroyed, one has to strive hard
        to protect it. When signs of destruction are seen, great fear and sorrow also arise. All that is Viparinama
        Dukkha regarding the human Pancaskandha.</p>
      <p>The painful feelings arising in various places of the body due to various causes from time to time and mental
        painful feelings arising due to various causes are called Dukkha Dukkha. In one lifetime, many such sufferings
        arise. If there is no human Pancaskandha, not even one of those sufferings arises. Therefore, it must be said
        that all those sufferings are produced by the human Pancaskandha itself. Similarly, that threefold suffering is
        produced by other Pancaskandhas as well. All Sankharas said to belong to Dukkha Satya above produce the
        threefold suffering for the person who is attached to them. Therefore, that group of Sankharas is the true
        suffering or Dukkha Satya.</p>
      <p><b>Dukkha Samudaya Arya Satya</b></p>
      <p>The true cause of the arising of suffering is called Dukkha Samudaya Arya Satya. That is Tanha. The Tanha meant
        here is the nature of attachment to the Pancaskandha taking it as a good thing, as a place where happiness
        exists. As long as that Tanha exists without being abandoned, the being acts to maintain the obtained
        Pancaskandha and to obtain future Pancaskandhas. It is to those actions that Kamma is said. As long as the being
        does Kamma, he receives Pancaskandha again and again. As long as Pancaskandha is received, the being is not
        freed from the said three sufferings. Therefore, that Tanha is called the true cause of producing suffering.</p>
      <p><b>Dukkha Nirodha Arya Satya</b></p>
      <p>Nibbana is called Dukkha Nirodha Arya Satya. As long as Pancaskandha exists, the said three kinds of suffering
        also exist. The three kinds of suffering do not exist when Pancaskandha is extinguished. Therefore, the
        cessation of Pancaskandha is called Dukkha Nirodha Arya Satya.</p>
      <p><b>Dukkha Nirodhagamini Patipada Arya Satya</b></p>
      <p>The eight Maggangas namely Samma Ditthi, Samma Sankappa, Samma Vaca, Samma Kammanta, Samma Ajiva, Samma Vayama,
        Samma Sati, Samma Samadhi arising in the Lokuttara Magga Citta are that Dukkha Nirodhagamini Patipada Arya
        Satya. Since this suffering comes again and again as long as Tanha exists, the only way to escape from suffering
        is destroying the Tanha that produces suffering. The said Lokuttara Magga arises destroying that Tanha. The only
        thing that has the power to destroy Tanha is that Noble Eightfold Path. Therefore, it is called Dukkha
        Nirodhagamini Patipada Arya Satya. (It should also be noted that everywhere here Pancaskandha refers only to
        Lokiya Dhammas.)</p>
      <p><b>Caturarya Satya in Brief</b></p>
      <p>The eighty-one Lokiya Cittas, fifty-one Cetasikas, twenty-eight Rupas - these are Dukkha Satya. Tanha or Lobha
        Cetasika is Samudaya Satya. Nibbana is Nirodha Satya. The eight Maggangas arising in the four Lokuttara Kusala
        Cittas are Magga Satya.</p>
      <p>The four Lokuttara Kusala Cittas, the Cetasikas other than the eight Maggangas arising in them, the four Phala
        Cittas and the Cetasikas arising in them - these Dhammas are not included in the Satya Sangaha. They do not
        belong to Caturarya Satya.</p>
      <p><b>Thus ends the Seventh Chapter named Samuccaya Sangaha.</b></p>
