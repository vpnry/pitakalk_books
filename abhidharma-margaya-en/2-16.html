      <p>The person who has attained Arupa Jhana is born in the Arupa world after death by the power of that Kusala.
        Jhana Cittas identical to the Arupa Kusala arise as the birth in the Arupa existence and for the unbroken
        continuity of that Arupa existence. They are Arupavacara Vipakas.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Akasanancayatana Vipaka Citta</li>
        <li>Vinnancayatana Vipaka Citta</li>
        <li>Akincannayatana Vipaka Citta</li>
        <li>Nevasannanasannayatana Vipaka Citta</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Thus, there are four Arupavacara Vipaka Cittas.</p>
      <p>In both Kama and Rupa worlds, the consciousness of beings exists depending on the physical body (Rupa-Kaya).
        They do not have the strength to exist without a physical body. Arupavacara Vipakas are developed to be able to
        exist without form. Therefore, a physical body does not arise with the Arupa rebirth consciousness. They live
        for a very long time with consciousness. Beings in the Kama world have to suffer endlessly due to maintaining a
        physical body. The formless (Arupi) being does not have any of that suffering. Formless beings have a happiness
        that is very similar to the bliss of Nibbana. Beings in the Kama world have a happiness obtained by gratifying
        the senses with external things. Formless beings do not need anything external for their happiness. The
        existence of beings in the Kama world is like rice. If nothing else is added, it has no taste. The formless
        existence is like a piece of cake. No need to add anything else to make it tasty. That life itself is a
        happiness for the formless being.</p>
      <p>There is an attainment called Nirodha Samapatti which belongs only to Anagamis and Arahants. It is living
        without consciousness. Only Anagamis and Arahants who have attained all Rupa and Arupa Jhanas can enter it.
        Arahants also develop Arupa Jhanas to be able to enter Nirodha Samapatti. The Arupa Jhana Cittas developed by
        Arahants, which do not have the power to produce results, are Arupavacara Kriya Cittas. There are four
        Arupavacara Kriya Cittas, such as Akasanancayatana Kriya Citta, etc.</p>
      <p>There are twelve Arupavacara Cittas: four Kusala Cittas, four Vipaka Cittas, and four Kriya Cittas. All of them
        are Fifth Jhana Cittas. In terms of feeling, they are Upekkha-sahagata Cittas. Although Arupavacara Cittas are
        similar to each other in being Fifth Jhana, the higher Arupa Jhana Cittas are more superior and excellent than
        the lower Arupa Jhana Cittas.</p>
      <p>Since Rupavacara and Arupavacara Cittas are a group of Cittas that do not belong to ordinary people, but belong
        only to noble people, and are developed and maintained by noble persons, they are also called <b>Mahaggata
          Cittas</b>. There are twenty-seven (27) Mahaggata Cittas.</p>
      <p>In Mahaggata Cittas, there are nine Kusala, nine Vipaka, and nine Kriya. There are three First Jhana Cittas.
        There are three each of Second Jhana, Third Jhana, and Fourth Jhana Cittas. There are fifteen Fifth Jhana
        Cittas. In Mahaggata, there are twelve Somanassa-sahagata Cittas. There are fifteen Upekkha-sahagata Cittas.</p>
      <p>The eighty-one (81) Cittas comprising fifty-four (54) Kamavacara Cittas, fifteen (15) Rupavacara Cittas, and
        twelve (12) Arupavacara Cittas are called "Lokiya Cittas" (Mundane Cittas). There are seventeen (17) Lokiya
        Kusala Cittas. There are thirty-two (32) Lokiya Vipaka Cittas. There are twenty (20) Kriya Cittas.</p>
      <p>In the eighty-one Lokiya Cittas, there are thirty-one (31) Somanassa-sahagata Cittas. There are forty-seven
        (47) Upekkha-sahagata Cittas. There are three (3) Domanassa-sahagata Cittas. (This count is given by including
        Sukha-sahagata body consciousness in Somanassa and Dukkha-sahagata body consciousness in Domanassa).</p>
