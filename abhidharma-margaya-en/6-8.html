      </div>
      <p>There are ten Akusala Kamma Pathas: Pranaghata (Killing), Adattadana (Stealing), Kamamithyacara (Sexual
        Misconduct), Mrsavada (Lying), Paisunyavacana (Slandering), Pharusavacana (Harsh Speech), Samphapralapa
        (Frivolous Talk), Abhidhya (Covetousness), Vyapada (Ill-will), and Mithyadrsti (Wrong View). In terms of Cittas,
        there are twelve Akusala Kammas.</p>
      <p>In the third chapter, six factors necessary for the arising of Cittas like Cakkhu Vinnana etc. were shown by
        the name Dvara. They are Vinnana Dvaras. There are also three factors necessary for the accomplishment of Kamma
        which use the name Dvara. They are called "Kamma Dvara". There are three Kamma Dvaras: Kaya Kamma Dvara, Vaci
        Kamma Dvara, and Mano Kamma Dvara. Kaya Kamma Dvara is the Kaya Vinnatti Rupa. Vaci Kamma Dvara is the Vaci
        Vinnatti Rupa. Vinnatti Rupas will be known in the Rupa section. Mano Kamma Dvara is the Citta itself. According
        to Dvara, Kamma is also divided into three: Kaya Kamma, Vak Kamma, and Manah Kamma.</p>
      <p>Of the ten Akusala Kamma Pathas, the three Kammas: Pranaghata, Adattadana, and Kamamithyacara are called Kaya
        Kamma because they mostly occur in the Kaya Dvara.</p>
      <p>The four: Mrsavada, Paisunyavacana, Pharusavacana, and Samphapralapa are called Vak Kamma because they mostly
        occur in the Vak Dvara.</p>
      <p>The three Kammas: Abhidhya, Vyapada, and Mithyadrsti are called Manah Kamma because they mostly occur in the
        Mano Dvara.</p>
      <p>Of the Akusala Kammas, the three: Pranatipata, Pharusavacana, and Vyapada arise from Dvesa Mula. The three:
        Kama Mithyacara, Abhidhya, and Mithyadrsti arise only from Lobha Mula. The remaining four Kammas occur from both
        Mulas. Those Kammas occur from Lobha Mula at some occasions and from Dvesa Mula at some occasions. Since Moha is
        the root of all Akusala, it is not specially mentioned.</p>
      <p><b>Kamavacara Kusala</b></p>
      <p>Kamavacara Kusala is also threefold as Kaya Kamma, Vak Kamma, and Manah Kamma. Kamavacara Kusala done with the
        help of some bodily limb is called Kaya Kamma. Kammas like preaching Dhamma etc. done with the help of speech
        are called Vak Kamma. Kusala like meditation done only by the mind is called Manah Kamma.</p>
      <p>Kamavacara Kusala is threefold as Dana, Sila, and Bhavana. In terms of Cittas, it is eightfold. Kamavacara
        Kusala is also tenfold as: Dana, Sila, Bhavana, Apacayana, Veyyavacca, Pattidana, Pattanumodana, Dhammasavana,
        Dhammadesana, and Ditthijjukamma.</p>
      <p>There are twenty Kamavacara Kammas in terms of Cittas: twelve Akusala Cittas and eight Kamavacara Kusala
        Cittas.</p>
      <p><b>Mahaggata Kusala</b></p>
      <p>Rupavacara Kusala is Manah Kamma. It is mental development (Bhavanamaya). It is fivefold according to Jhana
        division. Arupavacara Kusala is also Manah Kamma. It is mental development. It is fourfold according to Arammana
        division.</p>
      <p><b>Results of Akusalas</b></p>
      <p>Except for the Uddhacca Sahagata Citta which is the last of the Akusala Cittas, Patisandhi in the four Apayas
        is produced by the remaining eleven Cittas. During the Pavatti Kala, the seven Ahetuka Akusala Vipaka Cittas are
        produced in both Kama and Rupa worlds as appropriate by all twelve Akusala Cittas.</p>
      <p>By each Akusala Citta, Cakkhu Vinnana is produced when meeting unpleasant forms, Sota Vinnana when meeting
        unpleasant sounds, Ghana Vinnana when meeting unpleasant smells, Jivha Vinnana when meeting unpleasant tastes,
        Kaya Vinnana when unpleasant touch occurs, and Sampaticchana, Santirana, and Tadarammana are produced regarding
        those objects. Even for Supreme Buddhas, Akusala Vipaka Cittas arise when seeing unpleasant forms etc.</p>
      <p>Since the Uddhacca Sahagata Cetana is weak, it does not have enough power to produce an Apaya Patisandhi.</p>
