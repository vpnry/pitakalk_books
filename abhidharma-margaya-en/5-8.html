      <p>Six Atiparittarammana Vithis arise by the Ruparammana striking the Cakkhu Pasada after ten, eleven, twelve,
        thirteen, fourteen, fifteen Citta Khanas have passed since arising.</p>
      <p>If Vithi Cittas arise regarding an object striking the Pasada after ten Citta Khanas have passed since arising,
        before that object ceases, only Cittas up to Votthapana get to arise. There is no time for another Votthapana to
        arise in the Javana place instead of Javana. Since that object is very weak, Pancadvaravajjana etc. Vithi Cittas
        also do not arise in it. Only shaking of the Bhavanga happens by the striking of that object. Bhavanga Calana
        happens also from objects striking the Pasada after more than ten Citta Khanas. That is why there are six
        Atiparittarammana Vithis.</p>

      <p><b>Sotadvara Vithis etc.</b></p>
      <p>Sotadvara Atimahantarammana Vithi arises by the striking of a Saddarammana (sound object) on the Sota Pasada
        after one Citta Khana has passed since arising. The only difference from Cakkhudvara Atimahantarammana Vithi is
        the arising of Sota Vinnana instead of Cakkhu Vinnana. All fifteen Sotadvara Vithis should be understood
        according to Cakkhudvara Vithis. In Ghana-Jivha-Kaya Dvara Vithis also, the difference is only the arising of
        Ghana-Jivha-Kaya Vinnanas after Pancadvaravajjana. There are seventy-five Pancadvara Vithis.</p>
      <p>Objects such as Rupa, Sadda are felt very well to the Cittas of Atimahantarammana Vithis. Objects are felt well
        to the Cittas of Mahantarammana Vithis. Since a Javana Citta does not arise, objects are not felt well to
        Parittarammana Vithis. The feeling from them is very weak. If Parittarammana Vithis arise regarding a
        Ruparammana, a weak feeling like seen in a dream, like seen and not seen arises. When Parittarammana Vithis
        arise regarding a Saddarammana also, a weak feeling like heard and not heard arises. The feeling of other
        objects is also the same. Since Vithi Cittas do not arise in Atiparittarammana, a knowledge about that object
        does not arise at all. There is no use of those Vithis.</p>
      <p><b>Citta Niyama</b></p>
      <p>Rupavacara, Arupavacara, Lokuttara Cittas do not arise in these Pancadvara Vithis. In Cakkhudvara Vithis, the
        forty-six Cittas mentioned as Cakkhudvarika Cittas in Dvara Sangaha are obtained. The number of Cittas obtained
        in Sotadvara Vithis etc. should also be said as shown in Dvara Sangaha. In Pancadvara Vithis, in all ways, the
        fifty-four Kamavacara Cittas are obtained.</p>
      <p>The Pancadvaravajjana obtained in these Vithis is a Kriya Citta. Pancavinnana - Sampaticchana - Santirana are
        Vipakas. Votthapana is a Kriya Citta. Javana is Kusala, Akusala, or Kriya. Tadarammana are Vipakas.</p>
      <p>When Ishta or good Rupa Sadda etc. objects strike the Pasadas, Kusala Vipaka Pancavinnana, Sampaticchana,
        Santirana, Tadarammana arise. When Anishta or bad Rupa Sadda etc. meet the doors, Akusala Vipaka Pancavinnana,
        Sampaticchana, Santirana, Tadarammana become. When the object is very good, Somanassa Sahagata Santirana,
        Tadarammana become.</p>
      <p>Some animals consider even filth, which is a very bad thing, as good. Some with much wealth consider even some
        good things as bad. Therefore, it is difficult to decide the good or bad nature of objects. It is shown in the
        commentary that their good or bad nature should be done according to the consideration of average people.</p>
      <p>Whatever the person's idea about the object, Kusala Vipaka Cittas arise in a good object. Similarly, Akusala
        Vipaka Cittas arise in a bad object. There is no error in Kamma and Vipaka even if wrong ideas arise in persons.
        Therefore, for wrong-viewers who consider even the Buddha's body as an unsuitable, unpleasant object not fit to
        see, in seeing the Buddha, Kusala Vipaka Cakkhuvinnana, Sampaticchana, Santirana, Tadarammana arise. For the
        being who likes filth which is a bad thing, in seeing filth, Akusala Vipaka Cakkhuvinnana, Sampaticchana,
        Santirana, Tadarammana arise.</p>
      <p>Javana is something arising according to the ideas of persons. For those who desire Kusala having Kusala
        intention, Kusala Javanas can arise in all good, bad, medium objects. For those who live attached to sin without
        Yonisomanasikara away from Dhamma, Akusala Javanas can arise in all objects. Kriya Javanas arise in the Vithis
        of Arahants.</p>
      <p>Of the Cittas belonging to Cakkhudvara Vithi, only Cakkhuvinnana arises in the Cakkhu Vatthu. Other Cittas
        arise in the Hadaya Vatthu. However, since all of them arise solely because of the striking of Ruparammana on
        the Cakkhu Pasada, the complete Vithi is considered as a Cakkhudvara Vithi. Sotadvara Vithis etc. should also be
        understood in that method.</p>
