      <p>There are four Aharas namely <b>Kabalinkara Ahara, Phassa Ahara, Manosancetana Ahara, Vinnana Ahara</b>.</p>
      <p>The meaning of the word Ahara is 'the cause that produces a certain fruit'. There are many causes that produce
        various things. Among those causes, the four starting with Kabalinkara Ahara are given the name 'Ahara' because
        they are special causes for the arising and existence of Nama Rupas belonging to the internal continuum.</p>
      <p><b>Kabalinkara Ahara</b> is the nutritive essence (Oja) of the food consumed. By it, Aharaja Rupas are produced
        in the body. The power of a paddy seed is primary for producing a paddy plant. Fertilizer and water are the main
        causes for the growth and existence of the produced paddy plant for months. Similarly, for beings living on
        Kabalinkara Ahara, Kamma is primary for producing Rupas at Patisandhi. Thereafter, Utu and Ahara are the two
        main causes for the growth and living for a long time of the being. The lineage of Kammaja Rupas exists until
        death by the support of Utu and Ahara. Utu also can perform its function only if it receives the help of Ahara.
        Therefore, the support of Ahara is primary for the growth and living for a long time of the being. Therefore,
        Kabalinkara Ahara has been preached as a special cause.</p>
      <p><b>Phassa Ahara</b> is the Phassa Cetasika. By it, Vedana is produced. Birds live by taking food with their
        beaks. If the beak is lost, they will die without a way to take food. Similarly, these beings, obtaining the
        taste of the object due to Phassa, generating Vedanas, generate Tanha and prolong Samsara. If there is no
        Phassa, Vedana and Tanha cannot arise and Samsara will be cut off. Phassa is a main cause for the continuity of
        Samsara. Therefore, it has been preached by the name Ahara. </p>
      <p><b>Manosancetana Ahara</b> is the Kusala Akusala Cetana. By it, Patisandhi is produced in the three existences
        Kama - Rupa - Arupa. Birds live by flying from tree to tree and finding food. Similarly, these beings continue
        Samsara going from existence to existence by the power of Kamma. If there is no Kamma sending the being again
        and again from existence to existence, the continuity of Samsara will not occur. Kamma is also a special cause
        for the existence of Samsara continuously without interruption. Therefore, the name Ahara has been given to it
        too. </p>
      <p><b>Vinnana Ahara</b> is the Citta. By it, at Patisandhi, <b>Nama Dhammas</b> such as Phassa, Vedana etc. and
        Kammaja Rupas are produced. During the course of existence (Pavatti), Cittaja Rupas and Cetasika Dhammas are
        produced by it. If there is no Vinnana, Nama Rupas will not arise and Samsara will break. Vinnana is also a main
        cause for the continuity of Samsara. Therefore, the name Ahara has been given to it too.</p>
      <p>Of the four Aharas, Kabalinkara Ahara is a Rupa Ahara. The remaining three are Arupas. </p>
