      <p>Upekkha is the neutrality maintained towards beings. Only the fifth Jhana can be obtained from Upekkha
        meditation. The fifth Jhana can be obtained by developing Upekkha only by yogis who have already obtained the
        first, second, third, and fourth Jhanas from another meditation.</p>
      <p>Those who wish to develop Upekkha should consider the nature of the world with wisdom and be neutral towards
        beings. The eight worldly conditions such as gain and loss come to all beings. The nature of the world does not
        change according to one's wish. "Everyone is subject to worldly conditions. There is no one capable of
        maintaining the world according to one's wish. These beings receive happiness and suffering according to their
        own kamma. Beings come to suffering by going on the wrong path. They come to happiness by going on the right
        path. They do not become happy by someone wishing them to be happy. They do not become free from suffering by
        wishing them to be free from suffering. Therefore, worrying about the world is a useless effort." Thus,
        considering the nature of the world, one should practice Upekkha thinking "These beings receive happiness and
        suffering according to their own kamma".</p>
