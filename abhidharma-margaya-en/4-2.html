        <h2>2. Summary of Roots</h2><i class="material-icons share-icon" file-name="4-2.html">share</i>
      </div>
      <p>There are six roots: <b>“Lobha - Dosa - Moha - Alobha - Adosa - Amoha”</b>. Among them, Lobha - Dosa - Moha are
        three Akusala Cetasikas. Alobha - Adosa are two Sobhana Sadharana Cetasikas. Amoha is the Panna Cetasika.</p>
      <p>In the world, the name “Hetu” is used for things that are causes for the arising of certain things, just as
        fire is the cause for the arising of smoke. In this Abhidharma, the name Hetu is used for the six Dhammas Lobha
        etc. not because they are causes for the arising of something. Lobha etc. six help Citta - Cetasikas to be
        established in the object, just as roots help trees to stand on the ground without falling.</p>
      <p>Lobha sticks firmly to the Lobhaniya object. The Citta and Cetasikas associated with it stand unshaken in that
        object because of Lobha. Dvesha sticks firmly to the object. With its help, the associated Citta - Cetasikas
        also stand unshaken in the object. Similarly, due to Moha etc., the associated Citta - Cetasikas stand unshaken
        in the object. In this Dhamma, the name Hetu is used for Lobha etc. because they are supporting Dhammas for the
        associated Citta Cetasikas to stand unshaken in the object. <b>The Dhammas that help associated Dhammas to stand
          unshaken in the object are called Hetu.</b> There are four types of Hetu. These are called Mula Hetu.
        Everywhere in Abhidharma, the Ahetuka and Sahetuka nature of Paramartha Dhammas is stated with reference to the
        presence or absence of these Mula Hetus.</p>
      <p>The eighteen Cittas mentioned by the name Ahetuka in the Citta Chapter are Ahetuka Cittas because they lack
        Mula Hetus. The remaining seventy-one Cittas are Sahetuka Cittas because they have Hetus.</p>
      <p>Lobha - Dosa - Moha are Akusala Hetu. Only one or two of them are found in one Citta. Therefore, there are
        Ekahetuka and Dvihetuka Akusala, but no Tihetuka Akusala. The three Hetus Alobha etc. are Kusala Hetu as well.
        They are also Indeterminate (Abyakata) Hetu which are neither Kusala nor Akusala. In some Cittas, all three
        Hetus Alobha etc. are found. In some Cittas, the remaining two are found excluding Amoha Hetu. There is no Citta
        where only one of Alobha etc. is found.</p>
      <p>The two Moha Mula Cittas are Ekahetuka Cittas because they have only one Hetu called Moha. The remaining ten
        Akusala Cittas and the twelve Nana Vippayutta Kamavacara Sobhana Cittas, totaling twenty-two, are Dvihetuka
        Cittas. The remaining forty-seven Cittas are Tihetuka Cittas.</p>
