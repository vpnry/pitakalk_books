      <p><b>Part 1</b></p>
      <p>The Cittas shown in the Citta Chapter arise in beings performing various functions (works) according to a
        certain method. The name Citta Vithi is used for the series of Cittas arising in beings according to each cause.
        In showing <b>Citta Vithi</b>, the names used for Cittas in the Citta Chapter such as Akusala Citta - Lobha Mula
        Citta - Dvesha Mula Citta etc. are not used. In showing Vithi, Cittas are introduced by names given to them
        according to the function performed by each Citta. Therefore, to be able to learn the Citta Vithi section, this
        Summary of Functions must be well mastered.</p>
      <p><b>There are fourteen functions performed by Cittas: Patisandhi function, Bhavanga function, Avajjana function,
          Dassana function, Savana function, Aghana function, Sayana function, Phusana function, Sampaticchana function,
          Santirana function, Votthapana function, Javana function, Tadarammana function, and Cuti function.</b></p>
      <p><b>There is no Citta that does not perform at least one of these fourteen functions. Some Cittas perform two -
          three - four - five functions.</b></p>
      <p><b>Patisandhi function</b> is the linking of the present existence and the future existence without allowing
        the Citta lineage to be cut off by death.</p>
      <p><b>Bhavanga function</b> is the maintaining of the Citta lineage without allowing it to be cut off after being
        born in the new existence.</p>
      <p><b>Avajjana function</b> is the directing - turning of the Citta lineage towards a certain object so that a
        Citta Vithi arises.</p>
      <p><b>Dassana function</b> is seeing or knowing forms.</p>
      <p><b>Savana function</b> is hearing or knowing sounds.</p>
      <p><b>Aghana function</b> is smelling or knowing pleasant - unpleasant odors.</p>
      <p><b>Sayana function</b> is tasting or knowing the taste of food etc.</p>
      <p><b>Phusana function</b> is knowing things that touch the body.</p>
      <p><b>Sampaticchana function</b> is receiving forms etc. objects taken by Cakkhu Vinnana etc.</p>
      <p><b>Santirana function</b> is investigating forms etc. objects received by Sampaticchana.</p>
      <p><b>Votthapana function</b> is determining the nature of the investigated object.</p>
      <p><b>Javana function</b> is the excessive Citta speed regarding knowing the object and regarding actions like
        giving - taking etc.</p>
      <p><b>Tadarammana function</b> is taking the object taken by Javana.</p>
      <p><b>Cuti function</b> is ending the existence - departing from the existence.</p>
      <p>You cannot get a proper understanding of these functions performed by Cittas right now. A proper understanding
        of them comes when learning Citta Vithi. What you should do now is to well remember the functions and the Cittas
        that perform them. If not done so, learning the Vithi section will be difficult.</p>
      <p>For one person in one existence, there is only one Patisandhi Citta. Cuti Citta is also one. Bhavanga Cittas
        arise abundantly in beings. But their arising is not felt. The main part of Cittas is Javana Cittas. Apart from
        Bhavanga Cittas, Javana Cittas arise more in a being. It is Javana Cittas that know the object well, perform
        actions, and become merit - demerit.</p>
      <p><b>Part II</b></p>
      <p>The nineteen Cittas: two Upekkha Sahagata Santirana, eight Maha Vipaka, and nine Mahaggata Vipaka are Cittas
        that perform the three functions Patisandhi - Bhavanga - Cuti. Although each of those Cittas performs all three
        functions, it performs only one function at a time.</p>
      <p>The two Cittas Pancadvaravajjana and Manodvaravajjana are Cittas that perform the Avajjana function.</p>
      <p>Dassana function is performed by the two Cakkhu Vinnanas, Savana function by the two Sota Vinnanas, Aghana
        function by the two Ghana Vinnanas, Sayana function by the two Jivha Vinnanas, Phusana function by the two Kaya
        Vinnanas, and Sampaticchana function by the two Sampaticchana Cittas.</p>
      <p>Santirana function is performed by the three Santirana Cittas.</p>
      <p>Votthapana function is performed by the Manodvaravajjana Citta.</p>
      <p>The fifty-five Cittas: twelve Akusala Cittas - Hasituppada Citta - eight Maha Kusala Cittas - eight Maha Kriya
        - nine Mahaggata Kusala - nine Mahaggata Kriya - eight Lokuttara Cittas are Javana Cittas.</p>
      <p>The eleven Cittas: eight Maha Vipaka - three Santirana are Cittas having Tadarammana function.</p>
      <p>Two Upekkha Sahagata Santirana: are Cittas that perform all five functions Patisandhi - Bhavanga - Cuti -
        Santirana - Tadarammana.</p>
      <p>Eight Maha Vipaka: are Cittas that perform four functions Patisandhi - Bhavanga - Cuti - Tadarammana.</p>
      <p>Nine Mahaggata Vipaka: are Cittas that perform three functions as Patisandhi - Bhavanga - Cuti.</p>
      <p>Two functions Santirana - Tadarammana are performed by Somanassa Santirana.</p>
      <p>Two functions Votthapana - Avajjana are performed by Manodvaravajjana.</p>
      <p>The sixty-eight Cittas: fifty-five Javana Cittas, Pancadvaravajjana, two Sampaticchana, and ten Dvi Panca
        Vinnana are Cittas that perform only one function. It should be known that even Cittas that perform two or three
        functions perform only one function at a time.</p>
