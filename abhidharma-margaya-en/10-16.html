      <p><b>Lesson 19</b></p>
      <p>There are four Magga Vithis: Sotapatti Magga Vithi, Sakadagami Magga Vithi, Anagami Magga Vithi, and Arahatta
        Magga Vithi. Since there are five Sotapatti Magga consciousnesses according to the Jhana method such as "First
        Jhana Sotapatti Magga" etc., there are five Sotapatti Magga Vithis. Since the remaining Magga Vithis are also
        five each in the same way, there are twenty Magga Vithis. As each of those Vithis becomes two based on
        Mandapanna (one with dull wisdom) and Tikkhapanna (one with sharp wisdom), there are forty Magga Vithis.</p>
      <p>The First Jhana Sotapatti Magga Vithi is as follows:- When the yogi contemplating formations as impermanent
        etc. comes close to the arising of the Supramundane Path, after Bhavanga Calana and Bhavangupaccheda, the
        Manodvaravajjana consciousness arises and ceases taking a certain formation as the object. Following that, a
        Nana-sampayutta Kamavacara Kusala consciousness arises and ceases under the names Parikamma - Upacara - Anuloma
        by way of contemplating that same formation as impermanent or suffering or non-self. Then that same Kamavacara
        Kusala Javana arises and ceases under the name Gotrabhu taking Nirvana as the object. Following that, after the
        Sotapatti Magga consciousness arises once and the Sotapatti Phala consciousness arises twice realizing Nirvana,
        it becomes Bhavanga. This is the Sotapatti Magga Vithi of the Mandapanna.</p>
      <p>For the Tikkhapanna, the Parikamma consciousness does not arise. For him, after Kamavacara Javana arises three
        times under the names Upacara - Anuloma - Gotrabhu, the Magga consciousness arises once and the Phala
        consciousness arises three times, and then it becomes Bhavanga.</p>
      <p><b>Sotapatti Magga Vithi of the Mandapanna.</b></p>
      <p>Na - Da - Ma - Pa - U - A - Go - Ma - Pha - Pha - Bha.</p>
      <p><b>Sotapatti Magga Vithi of the Tikkhapanna.</b></p>
      <p>Na - Da - Ma - U - A - Go - Ma - Pha - Pha - Pha - Bha.</p>
      <p>Sakadagami - Anagami - Arahatta Magga Vithis are also like this. The only difference is that there is no
        Gotrabhu consciousness in them. The consciousness that arises in the place of the Gotrabhu consciousness in
        those Vithis is called <b>Vodana</b>. Its meaning is the consciousness that purifies by removing defilements
        that are obstacles to the arising of the Path consciousness.</p>
      <p><b>Sakadagami Magga Vithi of the Mandapanna.</b></p>
      <p>Na - Da - Ma - Pa - U - A - Vo - Ma - Pha - Pha - Bha.</p>
      <p><b>Vithi of the Tikkhapanna.</b></p>
      <p>Na - Da - Ma - U - A - Vo - Ma - Pha - Pha - Pha - Bha.</p>
      <p>The remaining Vithis should be understood in this manner.</p>
      <p><b>Paccavekkhana Vithi.</b></p>
      <p>After Magga Vithis, there arise Vithis reviewing the Path, reviewing the Fruit, reviewing Nirvana, reviewing
        abandoned defilements, and reviewing remaining defilements. Arahants do not have a Vithi reviewing remaining
        defilements. The consciousness series of Bhavanga Calana - Bhavangupaccheda - Manodvaravajjana - seven
        Paccavekkhana Javanas is the Paccavekkhana Vithi. One Paccavekkhana Vithi arises for reviewing each item such as
        the Path.</p>
      <p><b>Phala Samapatti Vithi</b></p>
      <p>Phala Samapatti Vithis are also forty, just like Magga Vithis. When a Sotapanna person who wishes to enter the
        Fruit he attained contemplates formations with the expectation of entering the Fruit, after Bhavanga Calana -
        Bhavangupaccheda, the Manodvaravajjana consciousness arises and ceases taking a certain formation as the object.
        Following that, taking those same formations as the object, after a Nana-sampayutta Kamavacara Kusala
        consciousness arises four times if the yogi is a Mandapanna, and three times if a Tikkhapanna as Anuloma Javana,
        the Sotapatti Phala Javana arises for many turns and then becomes Bhavanga. This is the Sotapatti Phala
        Samapatti Vithi. There is no fixed number for the Phala consciousnesses arising in Phala Samapatti Vithis. There
        can be hundreds of Phala consciousnesses arising in one Vithi. There can be thousands - hundred thousands - ten
        millions. However many Phala consciousnesses arise, the Vithi is one. The remaining Phala Samapatti Vithis
        should be understood according to this Sotapatti Phala Samapatti Vithi.</p>
