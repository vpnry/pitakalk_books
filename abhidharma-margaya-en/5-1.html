      <p>Knowing correctly the thing that meets the eye, knowing correctly the sounds coming to the ear, knowing
        correctly the smells - tastes - touches coming to the nose - tongue - body, saying a word by oneself, knowing
        the meaning of a word said by others, lifting of body parts, lowering, moving here and there, going, coming,
        giving, taking etc. - not even one of these matters is done by a single Citta. For each matter to happen, a
        series of Cittas must arise in order. The series of Cittas, the lines of Cittas arising as performing those
        respective matters are called “Citta Vithi”. In short, the lines of Cittas arising regarding each matter should
        be called Citta Vithi.</p>
      <p>The mind is very subtle. It is not something visible to the eye. Wind - cold - heat are not visible to the eye
        but are felt by the body. The mind is not something felt - caught by the body like that. Since it arises and
        perishes very quickly, the mind cannot be caught for an examination either. Because of these reasons, finding
        the nature of the mind is very difficult. The most difficult thing in knowing the nature of the mind is that the
        instrument for knowing it is itself. A knife which is a cutting instrument can cut something else. That knife
        cannot cut itself. Similarly, the mind which is the instrument of knowing cannot know the nature of that mind.
        Therefore, ordinary people who have not done any learning about the mind do not even feel that there is
        something called Citta Vithi. Even for people who learn - inquire about the mind, knowledge about the mind
        arises only as an inference that ‘these things must be like this’, but direct knowledge like seeing with the eye
        does not arise about the mind. Since knowing about the mind is very useful, try to develop knowledge even by
        inference.</p>
