      <p>Kamma is a name common to both Kusala and Akusala. Kusala is called Kusala Kamma, and Akusala is called Akusala
        Kamma.</p>
      <p>Kamma, which is generally one, is divided into four according to the functions performed by it, into four
        according to the order of giving results, into four according to the time of giving results, and into four
        according to the places where results are given.</p>
      <p><b>Krtya Kamma Catushka (Tetrad of Kamma according to Function)</b></p>
      <p>There are four functions performed by Kusala and Akusala Kammas. (1) Producing Vipaka Cittas and Rupas, (2)
        Helping the being born by a certain Kamma to live for some time, (3) Troubling the being from time to time
        without allowing them to live happily, (4) Killing the being born by a certain Kamma - these four are the
        functions performed by Kusala and Akusala Kammas.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Janaka Kamma (Reproductive Kamma)</li>
        <li>Upasthambhaka Kamma (Supportive Kamma)</li>
        <li>Upapidaka Kamma (Obstructive Kamma)</li>
        <li>Upaghataka Kamma (Destructive Kamma)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>There are four Kammas according to the functions performed. That four is called the Krtya Kamma Catushka.</p>
      <p>The Kusala and Akusala that produce Vipaka Cittas and Rupas at the time of Patisandhi and Pavatti are called
        <b>Janaka Kamma</b>. Not all Rupas are produced by Kamma. There is a group of Rupas produced by Kamma. They will
        be known in the Rupa section.
      </p>
      <p>The occasion when a being is first born in an existence is called the Patisandhi Kala. The time living after
        birth is called the Pavatti Kala. The great thing done by Kamma is causing Patisandhi. Sending to Sugati or
        sending to Apaya means causing Patisandhi. Not every Kamma has the power to give Patisandhi. Only powerful
        Kammas have the power to give Patisandhi. All Kammas have the power to produce Pavatti Vipaka. The Kamma that
        helps the being born by a certain Kusala or Akusala to live for a long time by preventing dangers and providing
        things necessary for living is called <b>Upasthambhaka Kamma</b>.</p>
      <p>Beings born by Kusala Kamma and beings born by Akusala Kamma receive the support of Kusala Kamma. It is said
        that for certain Vinipatika Asuras etc., the Akusala Kamma done in the past supports them to live for a long
        time.</p>
      <p>The Kamma that troubles a being born by another Kamma from time to time by causing various diseases, creating
        enemies, causing damage to fields and estates, causing loss of employment, bringing disgrace, making accusations
        etc. is called <b>Upapidaka Kamma</b>. It should be said that beings born by both Kusala and Akusala are
        troubled by Akusala Kammas from time to time. Kusala Upapidaka Kammas affecting beings are not prominent.</p>
      <p>The Kamma that kills a being born by another Kamma in the middle without allowing them to live for the time
        they should live according to that birth is called <b>Upaghataka Kamma</b>. Upacchedaka Kamma is another name
        for Upaghataka Kamma. Mostly, Upaghataka Kammas are Akusala Kammas. Kusala Upaghataka Kammas are not
        non-existent. They are not prominent.</p>
      <p>There is no special group of Kammas as Upasthambhaka, Upapidaka, and Upaghataka. Kusala and Akusala Janaka
        Kammas that have not found an opportunity to produce a result yet, or have finished producing their result,
        perform functions like Upasthambhana etc. at various occasions. Because of functions like Upasthambhana etc.,
        the Janaka Kamma itself is called by names like Upasthambhana Kamma etc.</p>
      <p>Some Upacchedaka Kammas only destroy the life of a being. They do not give their own result. Some Upacchedaka
        Kammas destroy the life of the being and also produce their own result by causing that being to go to Apaya in
        the next birth. The Upaghataka Kamma that came to King <b>Bimbisara</b> and Queen <b>Samavati</b> etc. only
        destroyed their lives. The Upaghataka Kammas that came to <b>Devadatta, Cincamanavika, and King Mahapratapa</b>
        etc. destroyed their lives and also caused them to go to Apaya. Causing to go to Apaya is the Upacchedaka Kamma
        producing its own result.</p>
      <p>Support, obstruction, and destruction by Kusala and Akusala Kammas apply not only to beings but also to Kammas.
        A Kusala or Akusala Kamma that is weak at the time of performance becomes powerful with the support of Kusala or
        Akusala Kammas done later. By that support, a Kamma that would cause birth in a poor family becomes powerful and
        causes birth in a rich family. A Kamma that would cause birth with short life becomes powerful and causes birth
        in a place with long life. A Kamma that would cause birth in a lower Deva world becomes powerful and causes
        birth in a higher Deva world. Similarly, by Akusala becoming powerful, an Akusala that would cause birth in the
        animal realm becomes one that causes birth in the Peta world, an Akusala that would cause birth in the Peta
        world becomes one that causes birth in Hell, and a Kamma that would cause birth in a Hell with less suffering
        becomes one that causes birth in a Hell with more suffering.</p>
      <p>A Kusala or Akusala Kamma that was powerful at the time of performance becomes weak later due to the
        obstruction of opposing Kusala or Akusala Kammas. A Kusala that had the power to cause birth in a high place
        like a royal family becomes weak due to the obstruction of Akusala and causes birth in a poor family. A Kusala
        Kamma that would cause birth in a higher Deva world declines and causes birth in a lower Deva world. An Akusala
        powerful enough to cause birth in a Great Hell becomes weak due to the obstruction of Kusala Kammas and causes
        birth in a small Hell or in Peta or animal realms. Those who have done evil deeds should do Kusala deeds
        opposing those sins to reduce their result-giving power.</p>
      <p>Certain Kusala or Akusala Kammas completely prevent the result of another Kamma. When the Lokuttara Arhan Magga
        Kusala arises, all Kammas that are to give results in future existences become ineffective (Avipaka). Therefore,
        the Arhan Magga Kusala is an Upaghata Kamma that cuts off all Kusala and Akusala Kammas.</p>
