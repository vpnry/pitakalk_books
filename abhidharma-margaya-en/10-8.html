      <p>Marananussati meditation is reflecting that oneself and everyone else living in the world will definitely come
        to death - that one cannot escape death by any power - that death is certain. Practice Marananussati meditation
        as shown below.</p>
      <p>“Great warriors who had strength like elephants, great millionaires who had wealth in crores, great scholars,
        great scientists, great kings, and great powerful devas and brahmas, all of them fell by the blow of death. How
        can a weak person like me escape death? I too will definitely come to death. It cannot be escaped in any way.
      </p>
      <p>Everyone who is born is born bringing death with them. They are born keeping death in front of them. Like
        cattle being led to the slaughterhouse, everyone travels towards death without stopping. Day by day death comes
        closer, there is no going further away.</p>
      <p>This life is very weak. It is like a ripe fruit on a tree. It is like a dew drop. It is like a water bubble. It
        is like a lump of foam. There is no moment death cannot come - no place it cannot come. Some die even in the
        mother's womb. Some die at birth. Some die in a few days after birth. Some die in a few weeks. Some die in a few
        months. Some die in a few years. Those who live long suffer immeasurable suffering of old age. When Universal
        Monarchs with great wealth and great powerful devas and brahmas also come to death, it is not a wonder that
        people like me come to death. This death can come to me even today. Life is uncertain. Death is certain.”</p>
