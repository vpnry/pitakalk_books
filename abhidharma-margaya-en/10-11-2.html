      <p>Karuna is the nature of not tolerating suffering arising in others just as one does not tolerate suffering
        arising in oneself, the nature of wishing to liberate suffering beings from suffering, the nature of trembling
        at the suffering of others. Repeatedly maintaining the mind associated with Karuna is Karuna meditation.</p>
      <p>The yogi who wishes to do it should first find an extremely suffering person who cannot do any job due to
        breaking of hands or feet or due to an incurable disease and lives by begging from others, consider his
        suffering with wisdom, and practice Karuna towards him saying "May this helpless person who has come to great
        suffering be free from suffering! May he be free!". Then one should practice Karuna towards suffering dear
        persons, neutral persons, and enemies. Karuna Jhana arises taking suffering beings as the object for those who
        engage in meditation having established equal Karuna towards oneself, one's friends, neutral persons, and
        enemies.</p>
      <p>Generally, those who practice Karuna meditation should consider the suffering of various beings with wisdom and
        practice Karuna meditation saying "May these beings be free from these sufferings!". There is no being who
        cannot be subjected to Karuna. Even beings considered as happy do not have much suffering. People who enjoy with
        five sensual pleasures committing various sins appear as if enjoying happiness, but they will come to great
        suffering after death. Considering that fact, Karuna can be practiced towards them. Millionaires and kings who
        spend time with great wealth also die one day and fall away from that wealth. Devas who enjoy sensual pleasures
        in delightful mansions and gardens like Nandana surrounded by thousands of goddesses, and Brahma kings with
        lifespans of aeons shining like great masses of fire also fall away when merits end. Considering thus with
        wisdom, one should practice Karuna towards everyone saying "May these beings be free from suffering".</p>
