      <p><b>Lesson 11</b></p>
      <p>Ultimate reality is not very evident to the public. What appears to them largely as things existing in the
        world are Concepts. Therefore, the one learning Abhidharma should also generate an understanding about Concepts.
        Generating an understanding about Concepts helps to identify Ultimate Reality purely by separating it from
        Concepts. Therefore, a fair description of Concepts is done here.</p>
      <p>Concepts are things that appear to the mind as if they truly exist, but when examined well are felt not to
        exist, and which do not exist in reality. To know whether something felt as existing truly exists or not, what
        should be done is to analyze that thing. If the thing that appeared as existing in the beginning disappears when
        analyzing, it is not something that truly exists. A 'cloth' is considered as something existing. If it is
        analyzed, a collection of threads will be obtained. It is a collection of threads, not a cloth. The cloth that
        appeared as existing earlier is not in that collection of threads. When the threads are separated, the cloth
        disappears because there is no cloth apart from the threads. All things that disappear when analyzed like the
        cloth are Concepts.</p>
      <p>There are two types of concepts: Meaning Concept (Attha Pannatti) and Name Concept (Nama Pannatti). Meaning
        Concepts are things that do not exist in ultimate reality but appear to the mind according to the spoken words.
        When the word 'table' is heard, something is felt to the mind of the listener because of that word. That is
        called the meaning of the word. That is the Meaning Concept. It should not be taken that the Meaning Concept
        felt according to the word is felt only according to the word and not by other methods. Meaning Concepts are
        also felt by facts such as seeing with the eye. Since they are largely felt according to words, the name Meaning
        Concept is given to them.</p>
      <p>There are many Meaning Concepts such as Form Concept, Group Concept, Being Concept, Direction Concept, Time
        Concept, etc.</p>
      <p>Earth, mountain, tree, creeper, flower, leaf, fruit, etc. which are felt to the mind according to the shapes
        established by great elements such as flatness, height, shortness, roundness, squareness, etc. are Form
        Concepts.</p>
      <p>Table, chair, bed, mat, pillow, vehicle, etc. which are felt to the mind as existing things based on the fact
        that various materials are collected in respective ways and connected to each other are Group Concepts.</p>
      <p>Deity, human, woman, man, elephant, horse, bull, etc. which are felt to the mind based on the five aggregates
        themselves are Being Concepts. East, West, North, South which are felt based on the rotation of the moon and sun
        are Direction Concepts.</p>
      <p>Morning, evening, day, night, year, month, date, etc. which are felt because of the rotation of the moon and
        sun are Time Concepts.</p>
      <p>Names such as cloth, table, chair, tree, stone, etc. which bring out some meaning to the mind of the listener
        are Name Concepts. <b>The difference between Sound and Name should be known.</b> Sound is an ultimate reality.
        Name is a concept. Therefore, it should be known that sound is not name. Just as a thing called cloth which does
        not exist in reality is felt to the mind of the one seeing a collection of threads, various Name Concepts are
        felt to the mind of the listener because of a collection of sounds. In 'Table' (Me-sa-ya), there are three
        sounds 'Me-sa-ya'. None of those sounds individually or all together is the Name. When the sounds 'Me-sa-ya' are
        heard in order, the Name Concept 'Table' is something felt to the mind of the listener because of those three
        sounds. Because of that Name, the Meaning Concept called Table arises in his mind. The Name Concept 'Table' is
        one thing. It is something felt to the mind because of the three sounds Me-sa-ya. Considering the said facts
        with wisdom, the difference between Sound and Name Concept should be understood. This is a place that can be
        confusing to some.</p>
      <p>Name Concept is sixfold as Existing Concept, Non-existing Concept, Existing-Non-existing Concept,
        Non-existing-Existing Concept, Existing-Existing Concept, and Non-existing-Non-existing Concept.</p>
      <p>The name that expresses matter, feeling, etc. which exist in ultimate reality is Existing Concept. Names such
        as Mind, Contact, Feeling, Perception, Volition, Earth, Water, etc. are <b>Existing Concepts</b>.</p>
      <p>Names that express tables, chairs, clothes, etc. which do not exist in ultimate reality are Non-existing
        Concepts. Concepts such as table, chair, cloth, earth, rock, deity, human, child, etc. are <b>Non-existing
          Concepts</b>.</p>
      <p>Names that indicate a non-existing thing based on a thing existing in ultimate reality such as Wise person,
        Devotee, Jealous person, Greedy person, White man, etc. are <b>Existing-Non-existing Concepts</b>. Wisdom is an
        ultimate reality. Person does not exist in ultimate reality. Therefore, 'Wise person' is an
        Existing-Non-existing Concept. Faith is an ultimate reality. Person is non-existent in ultimate reality.
        Therefore, 'Devotee' is an Existing-Non-existing Concept. White is an ultimate reality. It is color matter. Man
        is non-existent. Therefore, 'White man' is an Existing-Non-existing Concept.</p>
      <p>Names that indicate an existing thing based on a non-existing thing such as Woman's wisdom, Veena sound,
        Child's mind, etc. are <b>Non-existing-Existing Concepts</b>.</p>
      <p>Names such as Eye-consciousness, Ear-consciousness, etc. which indicate a thing existing in ultimate reality
        based on a thing existing in ultimate reality are <b>Existing-Existing Concepts</b>. In 'Eye-consciousness', the
        Eye sensitivity expressed by the name Eye and the Mind expressed by the name Consciousness are both things
        existing in ultimate reality.</p>
      <p>Names such as Girl, Boy, Son, etc. which indicate a non-existing thing based on a non-existing thing are
        <b>Non-existing-Non-existing Concepts</b>.
