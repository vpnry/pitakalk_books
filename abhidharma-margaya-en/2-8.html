      <p>Dosa (Hatred) is the opposing nature towards the object taken by the mind. It is the nature of disliking the
        object. Words such as anger, wrath, hatred, fear, disgust, and dissatisfaction also refer to Dosa. It is also
        called "Pratigha" because it arises as if striking against the object. The Dosamula Citta does not get divided
        by way of feeling like the Lobhamula Citta. It is always associated with Domanassa feeling. Domanassa feeling is
        the nature of experiencing the bad quality of the object. Sorrow is also a name for Domanassa feeling. The
        Dosamula Citta is divided only by way of Sanskara (prompting).</p>
      <p><b>Domanassa-sahagata Pratigha-sampayutta Asankharika Citta</b></p>
      <p><b>Domanassa-sahagata Pratigha-sampayutta Sasankharika Citta</b></p>
      <p>Thus, there are two Dosamula Cittas. The first Citta arises when one commits killing etc. on one's own accord
        without anyone's inducement. The second Citta arises when one commits killing etc. with inducement.</p>
      <p>When killing animals with a smile for sport, it is still Dosamula Cittas that arise. The Dosa arising in such
        occasions is subtle. The Dosa arising when killing an enemy coming to harm oneself is fierce. One should not
        misunderstand that there is no Dosa when killing animals with a smile for sport.</p>
      <p><b>Occasions when Dosamula Cittas Arise</b></p>
      <p>Dosamula Cittas arise in the commission of the seven Akusala Kamma Pathas: Panatipata (Killing), Pharusavaca
        (Harsh Speech), Vyapada (Ill-will), Adattadana (Stealing), Musavada (Lying), Pisunavaca (Slander), and
        Samphappalapa (Frivolous Talk).</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Dosamula Cittas arise in many people when speaking ill of others, when listening to such talk,
        when hearing one's own faults being spoken, when hearing one's shortcomings and weaknesses being spoken, when
        servants etc. are disobedient, when seeing others committing faults, when thinking that others will commit
        faults, when seeing others touching things one protects with care, when others ask for something one is attached
        to, when something one asks from others is not given, when others do not do the work one tells them to do, when
        others do not accept one's word, when others act as enemies towards oneself, when seeing enemies, and when
        remembering enmities done to oneself.</p>
      <p>Dosamula Cittas also arise as grief (Soka) when a loved one such as a parent or child dies, when other losses
        occur, and when great faults are committed by oneself.</p>
      <p>Dosamula Cittas arise with jealousy (Issa) when seeing those who eat and drink better than oneself, those who
        dress and wear ornaments better than oneself, those who travel in good vehicles, those who live in good houses,
        and those who receive respect and honor.</p>
      <p>In some people who are constantly looking for, speaking of, and thinking of others' faults, many Dosamula
        Akusala Cittas arise in a single day.</p>
