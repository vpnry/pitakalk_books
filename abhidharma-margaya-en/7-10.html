      <p>At the time near death, starting from the static moment of the seventeenth Citta backwards from the Cuti Citta,
        the arising of new Kammaja Rupas stops. The Kammaja Rupas born with the seventeenth Citta cease with the Cuti
        Citta. The Kammaja Rupas born earlier cease before the cessation of the Cuti Citta. The non-arising of Kammaja
        Rupas starting from the static moment of the seventeenth Citta from the Cuti Citta is not something that happens
        by the power of the Cuti Citta. After the stopping of the arising of Kammaja Rupas, there is space in that body
        for the arising of only sixteen new Cittas. Therefore, because of the stopping of the arising of Kammaja Rupas
        itself, the seventeenth Citta from that Citta becomes the Cuti Citta. After that, there are no Vatthu Rupas in
        that body to support the arising of Cittas. Since Cittas do not arise in that body after the Cuti Citta, the
        continuity of Cittaja Rupas also is cut off. Since there is no arising of Aharaja Rupas in a body devoid of
        Jivitindriya, the continuity of Aharaja Rupas also is cut off. After death, only the continuity of Utuja Rupas
        exists there for a long time. Thus, for the dying being, the arising and cutting off of Rupa continuities
        happens again and again in every existence.</p>
      <p><b>Process of Matter in Rupa World</b></p>
      <p>In the Rupa world, Ghana - Jivha - Kaya Bhava Kalapas and Aharaja Kalapas are not obtained. Therefore, for Rupa
        Brahmas, at the time of Patisandhi, four Kammaja Kalapas namely the three Cakkhu-Sotra Vatthu Dasakas and Jivita
        Navaka appear. During the course of existence, Cittaja and Utuja Kalapas are also obtained.</p>
      <p>For Asanna beings, Cakkhu - Sotra - Ghana - Jivha - Kaya - Bhava - Vatthu Dasakas and Sabda Rupa and all
        Cittaja Rupas are not obtained. For them, only Jivita Navaka Kalapas are obtained at Patisandhi. During the
        course of existence, Utuja Rupas except Sabda are obtained.</p>
      <p>Thus, the process of matter should be known by way of Patisandhi and Pavatti in the three existences namely
        Kama - Rupa - Asanna.</p>
      <p>In Kama Bhava, all twenty-eight Rupas are obtained. The five Rupas namely Ghana-Jivha Kaya Prasadas and two
        Bhava Rupas are not obtained in Rupa Bhava. The remaining twenty-three Rupas are obtained there. In Asanna
        Bhava, seventeen Rupas namely Jivita Navaka - three Lahutadi - Upacaya - Santati - Jarata - Aniccata - Akasa
        Dhatu are obtained. The eleven Rupas namely five Prasada Rupas, two Bhava Rupas, two Vinnatti Rupas, Hadaya
        Rupa, Sabda Rupa are not obtained in Asanna Bhava.</p>
      <p>The eight Rupas namely Sabda - two Vinnatti Rupas - three Lahutadi - Jarata Rupa - Aniccata Rupa are not
        obtained at the moment of Patisandhi. During the course of existence, all these Rupas are obtained.</p>
      <p>This is the method of process of matter.</p>
