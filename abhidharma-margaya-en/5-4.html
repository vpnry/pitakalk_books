      <p>If a Rupa that has passed one Citta Khana after arising strikes the Cakkhu Pasada, it immediately strikes the
        Bhavanga Citta existing in the Hadaya Vatthu also. Thereby, some change occurs in the Bhavanga Citta.</p>
      <p>It is like a shaking. Therefore, it is called “Bhavanga Calana” (Bhavanga shaking). After that Bhavanga Citta
        ceases, the Bhavanga Citta arising immediately after it also arises and ceases in a shaking manner receiving the
        striking of the Ruparammana. After that, the arising of Bhavanga Cittas stops, and the Pancadvaravajjana Citta
        adverting to the struck Ruparammana arises and ceases. Immediately after that, the Cakkhu Vinnana seeing that
        Rupa arises and ceases. Subsequently, the Sampaticchana Citta accepting that Ruparammana, the Santirana Citta
        investigating the nature of the Ruparammana, and the Votthapana Citta determining the nature of the Ruparammana
        arise and cease in order.</p>
      <p>Immediately after that, taking that Ruparammana as object as determined by the Votthapana Citta, any one Citta
        among the twenty-nine Kama Javanas arises and ceases seven times in order performing the Javana function.
        Subsequently, any one Citta among the eleven Tadarammana Cittas arises and ceases twice taking that Ruparammana
        as object just as taken by the Javana Citta. When the second Tadarammana Citta ceases, the Ruparammana struck on
        the Cakkhu Pasada also ceases as its lifespan of seventeen Citta Khanas is exhausted. After that, Bhavanga
        Cittas start to arise again as usual. The fourteen Cittas that arose taking the Rupa struck on the Cakkhu Pasada
        as object in order from Pancadvaravajjana Citta to the second Tadarammana Citta is the <b>Cakkhudvarika
          Atimahantarammana Vithi</b>.</p>
      <p>When showing Pancadvara Vithis and Manodvara Vithis arising taking present Rupas as object, the order of Cittas
        arisen from the place where those Rupas arose should be shown. The mentioned Atimahantarammana Vithi arises by
        the striking of a Rupa that has passed one Citta Khana time after arising. In the short time passed before the
        Ruparammana arose and struck the Pasada, a Bhavanga Citta arose in the continuum of the person in whom this
        Vithi arose. But the mentioned Ruparammana did not strike it. That Bhavanga Citta passed without receiving the
        striking of the Ruparammana is called by the name <b>Atita Bhavanga</b>. The Bhavanga Citta that arose as if
        shaking due to the striking of the Ruparammana is called by the name <b>Bhavanga Calana</b>. Since the Bhavanga
        lineage is cut off by the Bhavanga Citta arising receiving the striking of the Ruparammana immediately after
        that, that Citta is named <b>Bhavangupaccheda</b>. The Vithi should be said together with them as follows.
        Memorize this to make it easy for you to learn Vithi.</p>
      <p><b>Atita Bhavanga, Bhavanga Calana, Bhavangupaccheda, Pancadvaravajjana, Cakkhu Vinnana, Sampaticchana,
          Santirana, Votthapana, seven Javanas, two Tadarammanas</b>, this <b>order of Cittas is called Cakkhudvarika
          Atimahantarammana Vithi</b>.</p>
