      <p><b>Lesson 5</b></p>
      <p>There are three parts of merit: Dana, Sila, and Bhavana. All results that can be obtained from Dana and Sila
        are also obtained from Bhavana merit. However, the high results and high benefits obtained from Bhavana merit
        can only be obtained from Bhavana merit, not from Dana and Sila. Therefore, it should be known that the highest
        merit among merits is Bhavana merit.</p>
      <p>The highest thing to be obtained by practicing according to the Buddha's doctrine is Nirvana. It can be
        obtained by developing wisdom. There is no other way to obtain it except developing wisdom. The only thing to be
        done to develop wisdom until the Supramundane Knowledge that gives Nirvana arises is Vipassana meditation. Even
        for wisdom to develop through meditation, there must be Samadhi. Therefore, Samatha meditation should be done to
        develop Samadhi. To obtain the high results to be obtained by believing in Buddhism, every Buddhist should also
        practice some meditation.</p>
      <p>There are two methods of meditating. The method described in books like Visuddhimagga is the method of
        meditating to obtain Jhana Paths and Fruits in the present life itself. That too is not the method done by a lay
        person, but the method done by a monk. It is a very difficult course of action to follow. It can be done only by
        special persons who have the courage to dedicate their life to obtain dharmas such as Jhanas, giving up all
        other hopes in life. Such people are rare in the world. There is only one in ten thousand. The other method of
        meditating is to engage in meditation as much as possible while doing one's other work, to obtain Bhavana merit
        and to practice for Samsara. The person who does so should separate some amount of his time for meditation and
        practice some meditation during that time.</p>
      <p><b>The purpose of meditating is to elevate the state of the mind.</b> To develop the mind. Each person has two
        bodies: Nama-kaya and Rupa-kaya. Rupa-kaya is the body visible to the eye. Nama-kaya is the stream of
        consciousness element situated within that Rupa-kaya which controls and operates the Rupa-kaya. If the Nama-kaya
        departs from the body, there is no use that can be taken from the Rupa-kaya thereafter. It becomes something to
        be buried in the soil. The Rupa-kaya of the present life is not connected to the Rupa-kaya received in the
        future life. What connects to the future life lineage is the mind lineage of the being called Nama-kaya.
        Therefore, it should be known that the main part of the being is not the Rupa-kaya, but the Nama-kaya. It is the
        essence of the being. Therefore, more care should be given to the Nama-kaya.</p>
      <p>However, many people spend their entire time improving, protecting, and decorating the Rupa-kaya, and do
        nothing about the Nama-kaya. They do not know that it should be developed or protected. The loss caused by a
        harm to the Rupa-kaya, the suffering caused, is only for one life. By the spoiling of the Nama-kaya, there is
        harm to the entire lineage of lives. Therefore, one should keep a certain part of one's time to develop and
        protect the Nama-kaya. At least half an hour out of the twenty-four hours in a day should be separated for that.
        During that time, practice some meditation.</p>
      <p>Sila is the foundation of meditation. Therefore, the person meditating, if a lay person, should meditate
        establishing in Sila suitable for a lay person, and if a monk, in Sila suitable for a monk. By saying this, one
        should not think that if a person without pure Sila meditates, it will be of no use to him or it will be
        harmful. Meditation is suitable even for a person without pure Sila. Even if Sila is impure, if one meditates,
        Bhavana merit is obtained. When meditating for some time, he will gradually get the strength to observe Sila.
      </p>
      <p>Among Kammatthanas, Pathavi Kasina is a suitable Kammatthana for everyone. Kammatthanas suitable for
        temperament should be sought by those who meditate to obtain Jhanas etc. in this very life. Generally, for those
        who meditate, any Kammatthana is faultless.</p>
      <p>Pathavi Kasina can be made without much difficulty. Somewhat red clay should be taken for that. If dark red
        clay is taken, it will be confused with Lohita Kasina. Having removed trash and pebbles, the clay should be
        kneaded well. If there is a tray about ten or eleven inches in diameter, putting that clay into it, leveling it
        and drying it makes the Pathavi Kasina. Sometimes the level may be lost during drying. If so, it should be
        leveled again by applying clay on top.</p>
      <p>Pathavi Kasina is made on a plank as follows: A plank should be cut round to the size of the Kasina. Drive
        small nails about every two inches everywhere on it so that they protrude about half an inch. Then put the
        prepared red clay on it, covering the nails, and make the disk like a roti. Nails should be driven to prevent
        the clay layer from detaching from the plank after drying. If the level is lost after drying, it should be
        leveled again. If it is difficult to round the planks, a circle should be drawn on a square plank, nails driven
        in it, and the Kasina disk made. It is suitable to make the Kasina disk even on the ground in a suitable quiet
        place. When making the Kasina disk, a strong disk can be made by mixing a little cement with clay. After the
        Kasina disk made by mixing cement is dried, it should be leveled by applying only clay thinly on top.</p>
      <p><b>Lesson 6</b></p>
      <p>Taking the Kasina disk made as described to a quiet place with less noise where people do not come, preparing a
        seat about one span and four inches high to sit, placing the disk on the ground about two and a half cubits away
        from it, sitting cross-legged on the seat, one should meditate looking at the Kasina disk. It is very good to
        sit for meditation after bathing and cleaning the body and wearing clean clothes. Since it is not possible to do
        so always, if any place of the body is unclean, clean those places and sit for meditation. Having sat, first
        recollect the virtues of the Triple Gem as one knows and make the mind joyful.</p>
      <p>If unable to recollect the virtues of the Triple Gem, recollect at least the Buddha's virtues and generate joy.
        Then radiate loving-kindness to guardian deities and all beings a few times.</p>
      <p>Then thinking "I am also going on the path gone by the Great Beings such as the Buddha, by this practice I will
        also arrive at Nirvana arrived at by the Great Beings such as the Buddha", generating effort, keeping the eyes
        neither too open nor too closed directed at the Kasina disk, resolving two or three times "May my mind be
        established right here, may it not go out from here", tightening the Kasina disk with the mind as if holding
        something tight with the hand, establishing the mind in the Kasina disk, keeping the body motionless, without
        blinking, dwell attending "Pathavi - Pathavi" or "Earth - Earth".</p>
      <p>The difficult matter for a yogi is conquering the body. Conquering the body means bringing the body to a state
        where it can be kept motionless for an hour or two without difficulty. Samadhi is not obtained until the body
        can be kept motionless. When unable to stay looking with eyes open, close the eyes and recollect the Kasina.
        When recollecting the Kasina with eyes closed, if the Kasina appears to the mind as when looking with eyes open,
        dwell establishing the mind right there recollecting it without opening the eyes. If not seen, open the eyes
        again, look and meditate.</p>
      <p>Do not move the body because a fly landed on the body, an ant walked on the body, or a mosquito bit. Endure all
        that. Standing motionless is an unfamiliar work for the body. Therefore, when staying without moving, various
        pains arise here and there in the body. Bear them with endurance. With time, the body will adjust and reach a
        state where pains do not arise and a strange comfort is felt when staying motionless.</p>
      <p>When recollecting the Kasina disk with eyes closed, various other things may appear along with the Kasina disk.
        There is no benefit or harm from them. Do not pay attention to them. If one gets happy about those visible
        things and hopes for them, various things may start appearing endlessly and the meditation may get confused.
        Even during the time of staying with eyes open, various things may appear. None of those things seen are real.
        Do not be deceived by them. Various things start appearing during the time when Samadhi develops to some extent.
      </p>
      <p>While engaged in meditation, sometimes very small sounds that are not heard when in the natural state start to
        be heard. Do not pay attention to them thinking strange sounds are heard. Small sounds like the sound of a
        cockroach or gecko moving here and there can be heard as loud sounds. However loud a sound is heard, do not
        count it and carry on your meditation properly. Sometimes a light may arise. There is no benefit to meditation
        from it either. Therefore, without counting anything seen or heard strangely, without directing the mind to
        anything, attend only to the Kasina disk with effort.</p>
      <p>If one engages in meditation daily for about an hour a day for several months as described, a certain amount of
        Samadhi will arise. After that, meditation will become sweet to him. It will be a happiness. Mindfulness and
        wisdom will develop to some extent. The person who has obtained Samadhi will become a peaceful person living
        without sin.</p>
      <p>For yogis who have past merit, who carry on the Kasina meditation in the correct method with great effort,
        eliminating all faults with the hope of obtaining Jhanas in this very life, when carrying on the Kasina
        meditation for some time as described, when recollecting the Kasina disk with eyes closed, the Kasina disk
        starts to appear to the mind just as it appears when looking with eyes open without any confusion. The Kasina
        sign seen thus is called the Uggaha Nimitta.</p>
      <p>If the Uggaha Nimitta is obtained, one should go to another place without staying near the Kasina disk, sit
        comfortably and start attending to the Uggaha Nimitta. One attends to the Uggaha Nimitta also as "Pathavi,
        Pathavi". The Uggaha Nimitta is something that vanishes quickly if one engages in other work. It should be
        protected with great effort without letting it vanish.</p>
      <p>For the yogi who engages in meditation taking the Uggaha Nimitta as the object having obtained it, the Five
        Hindrances are calmed to a great extent. The mind is also calmed to a great extent by Upacara Samadhi. For the
        yogi who carries on meditation taking the Uggaha Nimitta as the object, when hindrances are suppressed more and
        more and the mind becomes clear, at some occasion the Kasina disk starts to appear very brightly like a polished
        gold disk, like the morning sun disk. That Kasina sign appearing brightly is called the Patibhaga Nimitta. For
        the yogi who carries on meditation taking the Patibhaga Nimitta as the object, hindrances are further removed,
        Samadhi develops, and at some occasion in that object, the First Rupavacara Jhana consciousness accompanied by
        the five factors: Vitakka, Vicara, Piti, Sukha, Ekaggata arises. That Jhana consciousness is also called Appana
        consciousness.</p>
      <p>However much developed a Kamavacara Javana consciousness is, it arises only seven times in an object adverted
        to once. After that it becomes Bhavanga. The Rupavacara Jhana consciousness, once obtained by adverting to the
        object, exists arising again and again in that very mind without falling into Bhavanga even for the whole day.
        <b>That is the difference between Kamavacara consciousness and Appana consciousness.</b>
