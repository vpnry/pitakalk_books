      <p>Thus there are seven Bojjhangas.</p>
      <p>At the moment the Lokuttara Magga arises, these seven Dhammas such as Smrti, Dhammavicaya etc. which arise
        associated with it, are called Bodhi because they help to realize the Truth perfectly without any deficiency by
        dispelling dangers such as the shrinking and shaking nature of the mind. The members (limbs) of that group of
        Dhammas called Bodhi are called Bojjhangas.</p>
      <p><b>Sati Sambojjhanga</b> is the Smrti Cetasika mentioned by names such as Satipatthana. By meditating, it grows
        gradually in the continuum of the Yogavacara and at the moment the Lokuttara Magga Citta arises, it arises
        associated with it helping the realization of Truth.</p>
      <p><b>Dhammavicaya Sambojjhanga</b> is the Panna Cetasika. That Panna is called Dhammavicaya because it
        investigates well the Nama Rupa Dhammas which are the ground for Vipassana as Anicca etc. That Panna grows
        gradually in the field of Sankharas which are the ground for Vipassana and becomes the Lokuttara Magga Nana.</p>
      <p><b>Viriya Sambojjhanga</b> is the strong Viriya indicated by the name Sammappadhana. It also grows gradually,
        dispels the Kilesas that cause retreating and shrinking in the field of Kusala Dhammas, and assists in the
        realization of Truth at the moment of Lokuttara Magga.</p>
      <p><b>Piti Sambojjhanga</b> is the Piti Cetasika. It also grows by way of meditation on Sankharas which are the
        ground for Vipassana, dispels the nature of dissatisfaction in Kusala Dhammas, grows gradually by way of
        meditation and assists in the realization of Truth at the moment of Magga.</p>
      <p><b>Passaddhi Sambojjhanga</b> is the two Passaddhis, Kaya and Citta. In meditating, it grows gradually, dispels
        the burning and heating nature of the mind, brings it to a calm and cool state, and assists in the realization
        of Truth at the moment of Lokuttara Magga. </p>
      <p><b>Samadhi Sambojjhanga</b> is the Ekaggata Cetasika. It also grows gradually by meditation, dispelling the
        restlessness of the mind, and assists in the realization of Truth.</p>
      <p><b>Upekkha Sambojjhanga</b> is the Tatramajjhattata Cetasika. It also grows gradually by meditation, completely
        dispelling the shrinking and shaking nature of the mind, and assists in the realization of Truth at the moment
        of Magga. </p>
