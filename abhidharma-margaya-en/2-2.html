      </div>
      <p>Abhidharma is the teaching of Ultimate Realities by the Tathagata. Therefore, one who learns Abhidharma must
        first learn what Ultimate Reality is.</p>
      <p>The thing that is felt by the mind, that is grasped by the mind through facts such as hearing spoken words,
        seeing written - printed things and various other things, thinking etc. is called "Meaning" (Artha). This word
        "Artha" is a word similar to the word "All". There is nothing in the world that is not an "Artha". There are
        many numbers of "Artha" in the world. Their quantity cannot be shown in any way.</p>
      <p>Among the things that are felt by the mind as existing, there are things that truly exist. There are also
        things that do not truly exist. The vast majority of things that appear to exist and are felt to exist by the
        world are things that do not exist in reality.</p>
      <p>If a person in the dark takes a firebrand and spins it rapidly, a circle of fire appears to those looking from
        a distance. But there is only the firebrand there, there is no circle of fire as it appears to be. That circle
        of fire is something that appears to exist because of the rapid movement of the firebrand.</p>
      <p>All things such as table, chair, bed, cloth, house, plate, cup, man, ox, dog, elephant etc. that are considered
        as existing by the world are also things that do not truly exist, just like the circle of fire.</p>
      <p>Whether something considered as existing truly exists or not can be known by analyzing that thing. A table is
        one thing considered as existing. If it is analyzed, it is seen that there are four legs, four planks connecting
        the four legs, and two or three planks on the top. None of those is the table. Apart from that group of
        materials, there is no such thing as a table either. All those materials can be called the table. All are not
        the table either. If all were the table, then however they were placed, those pieces of wood should be the
        table. If the pieces of wood are separated from each other or joined in another way, then a table is not seen.
        Therefore, it should be known that all those pieces of wood are not the table either. Since the pieces of wood
        are a heap of wood pieces and not a table, it should be known that there is no such thing as a table in reality.
        "Table" is a mere notion that arises according to the way pieces of wood are positioned.</p>
      <p>All inanimate objects such as beds, chairs, tables, plates, cups, clothes, trees, creepers etc.; and animate
        objects such as gods, humans, elephants, horses, cattle etc. which are considered as existing by the world, are
        things that do not truly exist in reality, just like the table. The name given to things that are considered as
        existing through mere notion of existence, without truly existing, is <b>Concept</b> (Pannatti).</p>
      <p>Of the two: meaning that does not truly exist and meaning that truly exists, the meaning that truly exists is
        superior, so it is called <b>Ultimate Reality</b> (Paramattha). The meaning of the word <b>Paramattha</b> is
        superior meaning, superior thing.</p>
      <p>To know whether something felt as existing is an Ultimate Reality or a Concept, that thing should be separated
        into parts and examined. If something disappears when divided like the table, that thing is not an Ultimate
        Reality or something that truly exists. The indivisible thing that remains at the end when objects are divided
        and examined is the Ultimate Reality.</p>
      <p>When it is said that there is no table in reality apart from the pieces of wood when the table is divided, you
        might think that the pieces of wood which are parts of the table are things that truly exist. Those pieces of
        wood can also be divided further. Therefore, they should also not be considered as Ultimate Realities.</p>
      <p>When a piece of wood is polished with sandpaper, the sawdust that is seen are small parts of the wood. If one
        is taken separately, that piece of wood which is so small that it is invisible to the eye can also be divided
        further. Therefore, that sawdust should also not be taken as Ultimate Realities. Ultimate Reality is the
        indivisible meaning obtained at the end of division.</p>
