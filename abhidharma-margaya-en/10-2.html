      <p><b>Lesson 3</b></p>
      <p>There are many Kammatthanas not for everyone to practice all of them, but for each person to select the
        Kammatthana most suitable for them and meditate. It is difficult to obtain Samadhi by practicing an unsuitable
        Kammatthana. One who meditates by selecting a suitable Kammatthana can obtain Samadhi quickly. The Kammatthana
        is selected according to the temperament (Carita).</p>
      <p>There are six temperaments: Raga Carita, Dosa Carita, Moha Carita, Saddha Carita, Buddhi Carita, and Vitakka
        Carita. Temperament is the nature of each person. Since everyone has Raga, Dosa etc., it is very difficult to
        understand the temperament.</p>
      <p>The person who has much Raga, in whom Raga arises frequently, is a <b>Raga Carita</b> (Greedy Temperament).
        Raga means Lobha (Greed). Since Mana (Conceit) is a mental factor that exists together with Lobha, the Raga
        Carita also has excessive Mana. Characteristics of a Raga Carita are: strong attachment to persons and objects,
        not being satisfied however much is received, preserving things more than necessary, being very greedy for food,
        drinks, clothes, ornaments etc., doing work beautifully, keeping the body, clothes, dwelling place and one's
        belongings beautifully, liking beautiful things etc.</p>
      <p>The person who frequently hates others, who has much Dosa, is a <b>Dosa Carita</b> (Hating Temperament). Issa
        (Envy), Macchariya (Stinginess), and Kukkucca (Worry) which arise together with Dosa are also abundant in the
        Dosa Carita. Characteristics of a Dosa Carita are: getting angry frequently, getting angry even for a very small
        matter, getting angry even without a cause, bearing grudges, inability to live as friends with others for a long
        time, getting agitated in every work, getting frightened, changing quickly, not having much attachment to
        anything, liking harsh food etc.</p>
      <p>The person who has excessive Moha is a <b>Moha Carita</b> (Deluded Temperament). Thina-Middha, Uddhacca,
        Kukkucca, and Vicikiccha are also excessive in the Moha Carita. Characteristics of a Moha Carita are: inability
        to understand deep matters, being easily deceived, considering right and wrong, good and bad according to
        others' words, difficulty in giving up accepted wrong views, inability to do anything correctly etc.</p>
      <p>The person who has excessive Saddha is a <b>Saddha Carita</b> (Faithful Temperament). Characteristics of a
        Saddha Carita are: liking to give, liking to see virtuous people, liking to listen to Dhamma, having faith in
        those worthy of faith, abundant joy etc. In some respects, the Saddha Carita is similar to the Raga Carita.</p>
      <p>The person who has much wisdom is a <b>Buddhi Carita</b> (Intellectual Temperament). Characteristics of a
        Buddhi Carita are: being obedient, having good friends, knowing moderation in food, having mindfulness and
        wisdom, ability to understand deep things, acting with investigation, not accepting just because others said so,
        doing everything methodically etc. In some respects, the Buddhi Carita is similar to the Dosa Carita.</p>
      <p>The person who has abundant Vitakka is a <b>Vitakka Carita</b> (Discursive Temperament). Characteristics of a
        Vitakka Carita are: difficulty in concentrating the mind, talking much, behaving together with many people,
        thinking about various things frequently, having no happiness in doing merit, changing ideas quickly etc. In
        some respects, the Vitakka Carita is similar to the Moha Carita.</p>
      <p><b>Kammatthanas Suitable for Temperaments</b></p>
      <p>The eleven Kammatthanas: Ten Asubhas and Kayagatasati are suitable for the <b>Raga Carita</b>. Kayagatasati is
        the meditation on parts such as hair. Raga is the special obstacle to Samadhi for the Raga Carita. These eleven
        Kammatthanas are opposed to Raga. They are meditations that remove Raga. Therefore, they are beneficial for the
        Raga Carita.</p>
      <p>The eight Kammatthanas: Four Appamannas and Four Kasinas - Nila, Pita, Lohita, Odata are suitable for the
        <b>Dosa Carita</b>. If practicing Appamanna meditation, sometimes Raga may arise in the Raga Carita regarding
        the persons who are the objects of meditation. Raga may also arise regarding colors like blue. Therefore, they
        are unsuitable for the Raga Carita. When meditating taking Asubhas as objects, Dosa or dissatisfaction regarding
        the meditation object may arise in the Dosa Carita. Therefore, Asubha meditation is unsuitable for the Dosa
        Carita.
      </p>
      <p>Anapana meditation is suitable for the <b>Moha Carita</b> and the <b>Vitakka Carita</b>. The Moha Carita is a
        distracted person like the Vitakka Carita. The in-breath and out-breath which arise again and again without
        stopping in the person exist as if calling the scattered mind back to oneself again and again. Therefore, it is
        specially suitable for Moha and Vitakka Caritas.</p>
      <p>The six Kammatthanas: Buddhanussati, Dhammanussati, Sanghanussati, Silanussati, Caganussati, and Devatanussati
        are suitable for the <b>Saddha Carita</b> as they are dear to the person with abundant faith.</p>
      <p>The four Kammatthanas: Marananussati, Upasamanussati, Ahare Patikkula Sanna, and Catudhatu Vavatthana are
        suitable for the <b>Buddhi Carita</b>. Since they are deep, they are suitable for the Buddhi Carita. They are
        not as suitable for others.</p>
      <p>The ten Kammatthanas: Six Kasinas - Pathavi, Apo, Tejo, Vayo, Akasa, Aloka and Four Aruppas are suitable for
        everyone.</p>
      <p>In doing Kasina meditation, a large Kasina disk is suitable for the Moha Carita. When practicing a small
        Kasina, the mind of the Moha Carita may become more deluded. A small Kasina disk of about one span and four
        inches is suitable for the Vitakka Carita. Because when meditating on a large Kasina disk, the mind of the
        Vitakka Carita goes to its parts. Kasina meditation is something that should be done by taking the entire disk
        to the mind at once.</p>
      <p><b>Lesson 4</b></p>
      <p><b>Kammatthanas where each Meditation is Obtained/Not Obtained</b></p>
      <p>Parikamma Bhavana is obtained in all forty Kammatthanas. Only Upacara Bhavana occurs in the ten Kammatthanas:
        Buddhanussati, Dhammanussati, Sanghanussati, Silanussati, Caganussati, Devatanussati, Upasamanussati,
        Marananussati, Ahare Patikkula Sanna, and Catudhatu Vavatthana. Appana Bhavana does not occur. Saying Appana
        Bhavana does not occur means Jhanas cannot be obtained from those ten meditations. Jhanas can be obtained from
        an object that can be easily established in the mind and made clear. Since Buddha virtues etc. are deep and
        many, it is difficult to grasp them well in the mind and establish the mind steadily in them. Therefore, from
        the said ten Kammatthanas, only Upacara Samadhi can be generated, not Rupavacara and Arupavacara Jhanas. Jhanas
        can be generated only from the remaining thirty Kammatthanas.</p>
      <p>It is also not possible to generate all Jhanas from all Kammatthanas that can generate Jhanas. The Jhanas that
        can be generated from respective Kammatthanas should be known as shown below.</p>
      <p>All five Jhanas can be generated from the eleven Kammatthanas: Ten Kasinas and Anapana.</p>
      <p>Only the First Jhana can be generated from the eleven Kammatthanas: Ten Asubhas and Kayagatasati. The yogi who
        has generated the First Jhana from them must practice another Kammatthana to generate the Second Jhana etc. In
        dead bodies and foul parts such as hair and body hair, there is only a nature that repels the mind of the person
        recollecting them, and absolutely no nature that attracts the mind. The mind is established in repulsive objects
        which have a nature of causing disgust to the mind and not even a little nature of causing happiness and
        attracting to oneself, by the power of Vitakka. There is no Vitakka in the Second Jhana etc. to take the mind to
        the object. Therefore, Jhanas without Vitakka do not arise in Asubha objects.</p>
      <p>The four Jhanas: First, Second, Third, and Fourth can be generated from the three Kammatthanas: Metta, Karuna,
        and Mudita. The Fifth Jhana cannot be obtained from them. Metta is the dharma opposed to Vyapada (Ill-will)
        arising from Domanassa (Grief). Karuna is the dharma opposed to Himsa (Cruelty) arising from Domanassa. Mudita
        is the dharma opposed to dissatisfaction called Arati arising from Domanassa. Therefore, for Metta, Karuna, and
        Mudita to arise powerfully, Somanassa (Joy) must be present. Since the four Jhanas starting from the First are
        accompanied by Somanassa, those Jhanas can be generated from the three starting with Metta. Since the Fifth
        Jhana is accompanied by Upekkha (Equanimity), it cannot be generated from the three starting with Metta.</p>
      <p>Only the Fifth Jhana can be generated from the Upekkha Kammatthana. Since Upekkha meditation is something to be
        done with neutrality towards beings, only a Jhana accompanied by Upekkha can be generated from it, not a Jhana
        accompanied by Somanassa.</p>
      <p>The four Arupavacara objects such as Kasinugghatimakasa are Kammatthanas that generate Arupa Jhanas.</p>
      <p><b>Meditation Signs (Bhavana Nimitta)</b></p>
      <p>Among the signs, Parikamma Nimitta and Uggaha Nimitta are obtained in all Kammatthanas as appropriate.
        Patibhaga Nimitta is obtained only in the twenty-two Kammatthanas: Ten Kasinas, Ten Asubhas, Kayagatasati
        (Meditation on parts such as hair), and Anapana meditation. Upacara and Appana Samadhis arise taking the
        Patibhaga Nimitta as the object.</p>
