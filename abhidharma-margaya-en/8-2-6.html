      <p>There are four Adhipati Dhammas namely <b>Chandadhipati Cittadhipati Viriyadhipati Vimansadhipati</b>.</p>
      <p>Those who make others conform to themselves, those who handle others according to their will are Adhipatis.
        Dhammas which make associated Dhammas conform to themselves are also called Adhipati. Chanda etc. make
        associated Dhammas conform to themselves. Therefore, those Dhammas are called Adhipatis.</p>
      <p>Chandadhipati is the Chanda Cetasika associated with Dvihetuka and Tihetuka Javanas.</p>
      <p>Cittadhipati is the Dvihetuka and Tihetuka Javana Citta. </p>
      <p>Viriyadhipati is the Viriya Cetasika associated with Dvihetuka and Tihetuka Javanas.</p>
      <p>Vimansadhipati is the Panna Cetasika. Ekahetuka and Ahetuka Javana Cittas and the Viriya associated with them
        do not reach the state of Adhipati. Chanda-Panna two Cetasikas do not associate with Ahetuka Ekahetuka Javanas
        either.</p>
      <p>Although all these four Chanda-Citta-Viriya-Vimansa are Adhipati Dhammas, only one of them becomes Adhipati at
        a time. In some Cittas, all three Chanda-Viriya-Vimansa are found. However, if Citta is Adhipati at that time,
        none of the three Cetasikas becomes Adhipati. If Chanda becomes Adhipati at any time, Citta-Viriya-Vimansa do
        not become Adhipati at that time. It is the same when Viriya - Vimansa become Adhipati.</p>
      <p>The difference between the two sides Indriya-Adhipati should also be understood. Indriyas also make other
        Dhammas conform to themselves. Adhipatis also make other Dhammas conform to themselves. Out of those two sides,
        Indriya Dhammas exercise dominance only in the domain of the function performed by them. They do so while
        conforming to the Adhipati Dhamma itself. Therefore, Indriyas are like subordinate kings. Adhipatis are like
        emperors.</p>
      <p>Chandadhipati is the strong desire to do something. Thinking there is nothing that cannot be done if there is
        desire, for the person who has put Chanda in front, many Cittas, either Kusala or Akusala associated with
        Chanda, arise according to his intention by way of accomplishing the desired thing. Cittas arising thus and
        Cetasikas associated with them are Dhammas arising having Chanda as Adhipati. How Citta etc. become Adhipati
        should be considered in this manner.</p>
