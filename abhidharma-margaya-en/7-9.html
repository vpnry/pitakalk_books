      <p>The way Rupas arise is shown according to the modes of birth of beings. There are four modes of birth namely
        Andaja, Jalabuja, Samsedaja, Opapatika. Beings born in an egg shell like snakes - birds - fish etc. are called
        <b>Andaja</b>. Beings born in a womb (placenta) like humans - quadrupeds etc. are called <b>Jalabuja</b>. Beings
        born from dead bodies - stagnant water - leaves - flowers etc. are called <b>Samsedaja</b>. Beings born by way
        of appearing according to Kamma like Devas - Brahmas etc. are called <b>Opapatika</b>.
      </p>
      <p>All these Rupas are obtained during the existence in the Kama world. For Samsedajas and Opapatikas, the seven
        Dasakas namely Cakkhu - Sota - Ghana - Jivha - Kaya - Bhava - Vatthu appear together with the Patisandhi Citta.
        For some of them, sometimes Cakkhu - Sota - Ghana - Bhava Dasakas are not obtained.</p>
      <p>The non-obtaining of certain Indriyas for certain beings happens due to the weakness of the Kamma that gave
        their Patisandhi. It also happens due to the prevention of the arising of Indriyas by some Akusala Kamma.</p>
      <p>Those who have not obtained Cakkhu Dasaka from those Dasakas are blind. Those who have not obtained Sotra
        Dasaka are deaf. Those who have not obtained Bhava Dasaka are neuter. Those who have not obtained Ghana Dasaka
        are rare.</p>
      <p>The four Dasakas namely Cakkhu - Sotra - Ghana - Bhava which are not obtained by some, are sometimes not
        obtained by Duggati Ahetuka and Sugati Ahetuka Samsedaja beings.</p>
      <p>For some Duggati Ahetuka Opapatikas, Cakkhu-Sotra-Bhava Dasakas are not obtained. It is said that there are no
        Opapatikas who do not obtain Ghana Dasaka. Except for the non-obtaining of Bhava Dasaka for Adikalpika Opapatika
        humans, there is no deficiency of Dasakas for Opapatikas in Sugati. Samsedaja beings are born and grow
        gradually. Opapatika beings are born with complete bodies. There is no growth for them after birth.</p>
      <p>Since they sleep in the mother's womb, Andaja-Jalabuja beings are called <b>Garbhasayika</b>.</p>
      <p>Garbhasayika beings do not obtain many Rupa Kalapas like Samsedaja Opapatika beings. At the Patisandhi moment,
        they obtain three Dasakas namely Kaya Bhava Vatthu. Of these, Bhava Dasaka is not obtained by some. For them,
        Cakkhu Sotra Ghana Jivha Dasakas appear during the course of existence. Short-lived beings stay in the mother's
        womb for a short time. Long-lived beings stay in the mother's womb for a long time. For beings staying in the
        mother's womb for a short time, the four Dasakas starting with Cakkhu appear quickly, and for beings staying in
        the mother's womb for a long time, they appear after a delay. For humans, the four Dasakas starting with Cakkhu
        appear on the last day of the eleventh week after Patisandhi. If stated in days, it is on the seventy-seventh
        day from conception. There are other teachers' views regarding this.</p>
      <p>Thus, Kammaja Kalapas appear for beings starting from the arising moment of the Patisandhi Citta. Cittaja Rupas
        appear starting from the arising moment of the second Citta. The second Citta is the Bhavanga Citta arising
        immediately after Patisandhi. It is the first Bhavanga Citta. Utuja Kalapas appear starting from the static time
        of the Patisandhi Citta. Aharaja Kalapas appear starting from the spreading of Oja in the body. Jivita Navaka
        Kalapas also exist in the bodies of beings. But a starting occasion for it is not shown.</p>
      <p>It was stated that for Garbhasayika beings, the three Dasakas namely Kaya-Bhava-Vatthu appear at the arising
        moment of the Patisandhi Citta. They are Kammaja Kalapas. It has also been stated above that Kammaja Rupas
        appear at all three moments of arising etc. of each Citta. The arising of those does not stop just by the
        appearing of the three Kaya-Bhava-Vatthu Dasakas at the arising moment of the Patisandhi Citta. Three new
        Kalapas appear again at the static moment of the Patisandhi Citta. Three new Kalapas appear at the dissolution
        moment of the Patisandhi Citta also. Thus, Kaya-Bhava-Vatthu Dasakas appear with the three moments of arising
        etc. of Cittas arising in the future. When it is the static moment of the Patisandhi Citta, there are nine
        Kalapas by the addition of the three Kalapas appeared at the static moment to the three Kalapas appeared at its
        arising moment. When it is the dissolution moment of the Patisandhi Citta, there are nine Kalapas by the
        addition of the six Kalapas appeared at arising and static moments to the three Kalapas appearing there. Thus,
        it should be understood how the number of Kalapas increases by the addition of Kalapas appeared at previous
        moments to the Kalapas appearing at every Citta moment in the future.</p>
      <p>The Patisandhi Citta and the three Kammaja Kalapas born with it cease at the fifty-first moment from the
        arising moment of the Patisandhi Citta. That is the dissolution moment of the sixteenth Bhavanga. By the static
        moment of the sixteenth Bhavanga, there are one hundred and fifty Kammaja Kalapas. When the fifty-first moment
        arrives, with the Kalapas arising and ceasing there, there are one hundred and fifty-three Kammaja Kalapas.
        Since there are three Kalapas arising and three Kalapas ceasing at future Citta moments, there is no change in
        the number of Kalapas. To this mass of Rupa Kalapas, a Cittaja Kalapa is also added at every arising moment of
        Cittas starting from the arising moment of the first Bhavanga. Since every Kalapa produces Utuja Kalapas at
        their respective static moments, they are also added. The Oja of the food eaten by the mother reaches the body
        of the being in the mother's womb. From then on, Aharaja Rupas are also added to the above mentioned group of
        Rupas. Thus, the continuities of Rupa Kalapas produced by the four causes like Kamma etc. in the bodies of
        beings in the Kama world exist as long as they live.</p>
