      <p><b>Saddha, Sati, Hiri, Ottappa, Alobha, Adosa, Tatramajjhattata, Kayapassaddhi, Cittapassaddhi, Kayalahuta,
          Cittalahuta, Kayamuduta, Cittamuduta, Kayakammannata, Cittakammannata, Kayapagunnata, Cittapagunnata,
          Kayujjukata, Cittujjukata</b> are the nineteen Sobhana Sadharana Cetasikas.</p>
      <p><b>Saddha</b></p>
      <p>The trust in Buddha etc., the nature of accepting the virtues of Buddha etc. is called Saddha. It is also
        called Shraddha. It is also called "Pahadima" (clarity/confidence). This Shraddha is a great power in doing
        Kusalas. It is said that it is like a hand in the sense of taking Kusalas, like wealth in the sense of bringing
        all resources, and like a seed since it is the root of all Kusalas.</p>
      <p><b>Sati</b></p>
      <p>Mindfulness is called Sati. The nature of the being's mind is to travel - to exist only in the Akusala side. By
        this Cetasika, the being's mind is not allowed to travel only in the Akusala side, and is established in the
        Kusala side.</p>
      <p><b>Hiri - Ottappa</b></p>
      <p>The nature of loathing sin, being ashamed of sin is called Hiri. The nature of fearing sin is called Ottappa.
        Because of these two, Hiri and Otappa, virtuous people refrain from sin and behave well.</p>
      <p><b>Alobha</b></p>
      <p>The nature of not clinging to the object is called Alobha. The Citta associated with Alobha exists in the
        object without clinging like water on a lotus leaf. Alobha is a nature opposed to Lobha. </p>
      <p><b>Adosa</b></p>
      <p>Adosa means Maitri (Loving-kindness). It is the nature opposed to Dvesha. </p>
      <p><b>Tatramajjhattata</b></p>
      <p>The nature of keeping the impulses of Citta and Cetasikas arising bound together balanced, without letting them
        increase or decrease, is called "Tatramajjhattata". </p>
      <p><b>Kayapassaddhi - Cittapassaddhi</b></p>
      <p>In Kayapassaddhi, what is called "Kaya" are the Cetasikas. In Cittapassaddhi, what is called "Citta" is the
        Sobhana Citta. The tranquility of Cetasikas is called "Kayapassaddhi". The tranquility of Citta is called
        "Cittapassaddhi". These two Dhammas are two Dhammas opposed to defilements like Uddhacca that make Citta and
        Cetasikas restless.</p>
      <p><b>Kayalahuta - Cittalahuta</b></p>
      <p>The lightness of Cetasikas is called "Kayalahuta". The lightness of Citta is called "Cittalahuta". These two
        Cetasikas are two Dhammas opposed to Thina-Middha etc. that weaken Citta and Cetasikas by making them heavy like
        the body of a sick person.</p>
      <p><b>Kayamuduta - Cittamuduta</b></p>
      <p>The malleability of Cetasikas is called "Kayamuduta". The malleability of Citta is called "Cittamuduta". These
        two Cetasikas are two Dhammas opposed to defilements like Ditthi and Mana that make Citta and Cetasikas hard -
        rigid. </p>
      <p><b>Kayakammannata - Cittakammannata</b></p>
      <p>The wieldiness of Cetasikas is called "Kayakammannata". The wieldiness of Citta is called "Cittakammannata".
        Wieldiness means being suitable for Kusala action, just as gold is suitable for any subtle work. These two
        Cetasikas are opposed to defilements that make Citta and Cetasikas unfit for action. </p>
      <p><b>Kayapagunnata - Cittapagunnata</b></p>
      <p>The proficiency of Cetasikas in their respective actions is called "Kayapagunnata". The proficiency of Citta is
        called "Cittapagunnata". These two Cetasikas are opposed to defilements like lack of faith that make Citta and
        Cetasikas sick and weak. </p>
      <p><b>Kayujjukata - Cittujjukata</b></p>
      <p>The rectitude (straightness) of Cetasikas is called "Kayujjukata". The rectitude of Citta is called
        "Cittujjukata". These two Dhammas are opposed to Maya, Satheyya etc.</p>
      <p>These nineteen Cetasikas are called Sobhana Sadharana because they apply to all Sobhana Cittas without
        distinction. </p>
