      <p>For the yogi who continues Vipassana meditation, places where the path can be mistaken arise due to the
        appearance of imperfections such as illumination. The knowledge that knows correctly "This is the true path,
        this is not the path" in those instances is Maggamagga Nanadassana Visuddhi.</p>
      <p>The yogi who has discerned Nama and Rupa with conditions should next practice Tilakkhana Bhavana.</p>
      <p><b>The Three Characteristics</b></p>
      <p>There are three characteristics of formations: Anicca Lakkhana, Dukkha Lakkhana, and Anatta Lakkhana.</p>
      <p>The nature of not remaining stable after arising - the nature of breaking up is the <b>Anicca Lakkhana</b> of
        formations. Since they possess the characteristic of impermanence, formations are impermanent.</p>
      <p>For the one who considers the group of formations which are not stable and definitely breaking up as 'mine' and
        clings to them as 'mine', much fatigue has to be undergone regarding protecting those formations and regarding
        obtaining new formations in place of those breaking up. Fear also constantly arises in him regarding the
        breaking up of formations. The nature of causing fear and fatigue is the nature of formations. That is the
        <b>Dukkha Lakkhana</b> of formations. Since they possess the characteristic of suffering, formations are
        suffering.
      </p>
      <p>If one considers something as self, one should consider a stable and substantial thing. That stable and
        substantial nature does not exist in formations which are decaying and breaking up. In them, there is a nature
        opposite to the stable and substantial nature. The absence of a stable and substantial nature is the <b>Anatta
          Lakkhana</b> of formations. Since they possess the characteristic of non-self, formations are non-self.</p>
      <p><b>Three Anupassanas</b></p>
      <p>There are three Anupassanas: "Aniccanupassana - Dukkhanupassana - Anattanupassana". Anupassana means
        meditation.</p>
      <p>Looking with wisdom repeatedly thinking of Nama and Rupa and their impermanence as "Form is impermanent,
        feeling is impermanent" etc. is <b>Aniccanupassana</b>. In other words, it is the meditation on impermanence.
      </p>
      <p>Thinking repeatedly of Nama and Rupa and their characteristic of suffering as "Form is suffering, feeling is
        suffering" etc. is <b>Dukkhanupassana</b>.</p>
      <p>Thinking repeatedly of Nama and Rupa and their characteristic of non-self as "Form is non-self, feeling is
        non-self" is <b>Anattanupassana</b>.</p>
      <p>The yogi who has developed Kankhavitarana Visuddhi should next engage in meditation by way of repeatedly
        remembering and looking at formations as impermanent etc. In other words, doing the Tilakkhana Bhavana. In doing
        so, if one goes to look at the characteristics such as impermanence of formations by taking them one by one, it
        is a work that cannot be finished, so it should not be done so. Even if one takes all formations at once in the
        mind and thinks of their impermanence etc., since formations are very many, a clear understanding cannot be
        developed. Therefore, the yogi practicing Vipassana on formations should take those respective formations by way
        of groups through methods such as aggregates, and practice Vipassana in various ways such as "Form is
        impermanent - feeling is impermanent". After the three characteristics such as impermanence of formations are
        well understood, one should start looking at the arising and breaking up of those Nama and Rupa. That should be
        done according to causes as "When these causes exist, these dhammas become; when causes do not exist, they
        cease", and also looking at the arising and ceasing of Nama and Rupa without expecting causes. The arising of
        formations is called <b>'Udaya'</b> and the breaking up is called <b>'Vaya'</b>. When the Udayabbaya Nana
        develops and sharpens in the yogi who is looking at the arising and breaking up of formations, Vipassana
        Upakkilesas appear.</p>
