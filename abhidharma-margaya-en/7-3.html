      <p>Rupa - Sabda - Gandha - Rasa - Sprastavya are the five Gocara Rupas. These five Rupas are the objects for the
        five Prasadas such as Cakkhu etc. Therefore, they are called Gocara Rupas. Since they are grasped by the five
        Prasadas such as Cakkhu etc., they are also called Visaya Rupas.</p>
      <p><b>Rupa</b></p>
      <p>Here, what is called Rupa is the color that strikes the Cakkhu Prasada and is grasped by it. It is also called
        Varna Rupa. Only this Varna Rupa strikes the Cakkhu Prasada and is grasped by it. Except for color, objects that
        are grasped by the hand are not seen by the eye. Where it is said "Rupakkhandha", the word Rupa refers to the
        twenty-eight Rupas. This Varna Rupa is also one Rupa belonging to those twenty-eight. In the context of Gocara
        Rupas, the word Rupa refers only to the Varna Dhatu. The name Rupa is given to all Rupas in the sense of 'that
        which undergoes change due to cold, heat etc.'. The name Rupa is given to Varna Dhatu in the sense of 'that
        which is seen'. Of the twenty-eight Rupas, only this Varna Rupa is seen by the eye. Other Rupas are not seen by
        the eye.</p>
      <p><b>Sabda</b></p>
      <p>The thing that strikes the Sota Prasada and is known by means of Sota Prasada is Sabda (Sound). It is a Rupa
        that arises from striking and bursting and vanishes quickly. Saying 'vanishes quickly' does not mean that its
        lifespan is shorter than other Rupas, but that its continuity does not last long.</p>
      <p><b>Gandha</b></p>
      <p>The Rupa that strikes the Ghana Prasada and is known by means of Ghana Prasada is Gandha (Smell). It exists
        excessively in some objects and slightly in some objects. Although Gandha exists in some measure in every object
        where the four elements exist, the Gandha in some objects is not felt because it is very subtle.</p>
      <p><b>Rasa</b></p>
      <p>The Rupa that strikes the Jivha Prasada and is known by means of the tongue is Rasa (Taste). It becomes
        manifold according to the differences of the Great Essential Elements. Although Rasa exists in every object,
        Rasa is not felt in some objects because they do not dissolve and because it is very subtle. To be able to know
        the taste, it must dissolve and touch the Jivha Prasada.</p>
      <p><b>Sprastavya </b></p>
      <p>The Rupa that strikes the Kaya Prasada and is known by means of Kaya Prasada is called Sprastavya (Tangible).
        It is not a separate Rupa like Rupa, Sabda etc. What strikes the Kaya Prasada are the three Great Essentials:
        Pathavi, Tejo, and Vayo. What is felt to the body as hard nature is Pathavi Dhatu. The cold nature and hot
        nature felt to the body is Tejo Dhatu. The moving, pushing nature felt to the body is Vayo Dhatu. Apo Dhatu is
        not something that is touched. Since Rupas that are objects for all five Prasadas must be shown when showing
        Gocara Rupas, the three Bhuta Rupas which are objects for Kaya Prasada are shown by the name Sprastavya. When
        counting Rupas, a Rupa called Sprastavya Rupa is not counted.</p>
      <p>In one object, all of Rupa - Gandha - Rasa - Sprastavya exist. When an object is held by the hand, what is
        grasped by the hand and felt is the Pathavi Dhatu in it. What is seen by the eye is the Varna Rupa. The part
        seen by the eye is not grasped by the hand. The part grasped by the hand is not seen by the eye. The parts felt
        to the nose and tongue in it are felt only to the nose and tongue, not to the hand. Not seen by the eye.
        Thinking that what is grasped by the hand and what is seen by the eye are the same thing is a wrong
        understanding due to not knowing the analysis of Dhamma.</p>
      <p><b>Two Bhava Rupas</b></p>
      <p>There are two Bhava Rupas called Stri Bhava Rupa and Purusa Bhava Rupa. The Rupa that imparts the female nature
        to the body of a being is Stri Bhava Rupa. The Rupa that imparts the male nature is Purusa Bhava Rupa. These two
        Rupas are two Rupas that exercise their power over the bodily Rupas. Therefore, Stri Bhava Rupa is also called
        "<b>Itthindriya</b>" and Purusa Bhava Rupa is also called "<b>Purusindriya</b>". Bhava Rupas arise for beings
        simultaneously with the Patisandhi Citta. Everyone's body is created from the Four Great Essentials. There is no
        male-female difference in them. When the body is formed from the Great Essentials, the body with Stri Bhava Rupa
        is formed in the female form by its influence. The body with Purusa Bhava Rupa is formed in the male form by its
        influence. Bhava Rupas are spread everywhere in the body.</p>
      <p><b>Hadaya Vatthu Rupa</b></p>
      <p>The places for the arising of Cakkhu Vinnana etc. are the five Prasada Rupas. The Rupa which is the place for
        the arising of the remaining Cittas except the five Vinnanas is the Hadaya Vatthu Rupa. It exists in the blood
        inside the heart cavity.</p>
      <p><b>Jivitindriya Rupa</b></p>
      <p>The Rupa that protects and causes to live the Rupas arising bound with itself so that they last for a long time
        in continuity is called Jivitindriya. In a body, there are Rupas produced by four causes: Kamma - Citta - Utu -
        Ahara. Of those four causes, the three causes Citta - Utu - Ahara exist near the Rupas produced by them.
        Therefore, a separate thing is not needed to govern the Rupas produced by Citta etc. causes. Kammaja Rupas in
        the continuity of a being are produced by a Kamma that is not present at that occasion, but has arisen and
        ceased in the past. Therefore, there must be another thing that protects the Kammaja Rupa continuities to enable
        them to last for a long time. The power that protects Kammaja Rupas and maintains their continuity for a long
        time is this Jivitindriya Rupa. By the influence of Jivitindriya, Kammaja Rupa continuities exist unbroken for
        hundreds and thousands of years. </p>
      <p><b>Ahara Rupa</b></p>
      <p>The nutritive essence in food which produces a separate group of Rupas in the body, strengthens it and
        maintains it for a long time is Ahara Rupa. That nutritive essence generally exists in all objects. However, the
        nutritive essence in all things is not suitable for all beings. Respective beings eat food suitable for their
        respective bodies. Their bodies are sustained by the nutritive essence in them.</p>
      <p>These eighteen Rupas mentioned from Pathavi Dhatu up to Ahara Rupa are Rupas produced directly by causes such
        as Kamma. Therefore, they are called Nipphanna Rupas. Furthermore, they are also called Svabhava Rupa -
        Svalaksana Rupa - Rupa Rupa.</p>
