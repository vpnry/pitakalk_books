      <p>The knowledge that removes the self-view by seeing Nama and Rupa as they really are is <b>Ditthi Visuddhi</b>.
        Knowing Nama and Rupa separately by way of Lakkhana (Characteristic), Rasa (Function), Paccupatthana
        (Manifestation), and Padatthana (Proximate Cause) should also be called Ditthi Visuddhi.</p>
      <p><b>Lakkhana</b> is the nature of each ultimate reality. The body of the ultimate reality is also that
        characteristic itself.</p>
      <p>Each ultimate reality has a function performed by it. Also, ultimate realities have a capability to perform
        that respective function. That capability is also called 'Sampatti'. It is to these two, function and
        capability, that <b>'Rasa'</b> is used.</p>
      <p>There is also a result produced by the function performed by an ultimate reality. That result is called
        <b>'Paccupatthana'</b>. Furthermore, that ultimate reality appears to the mind of the yogi examining ultimate
        realities in a certain way. That way of appearing is also called 'Paccupatthana'.
      </p>
      <p>The main and apparent cause for the arising of each ultimate reality is called <b>'Padatthana'</b>. It is also
        called 'proximate cause'.</p>
      <p>Of these four facts, Lakkhana should be known like the heat nature of fire. Rasa should be known like the
        burning nature of fire. Paccupatthana should be known like the nature of producing smoke in fire. Padatthana
        should be known like the firewood that produces fire. The characteristic of fire is heat nature. Rasa is the
        burning nature or cooking nature. The manifestation of fire is emitting smoke. The proximate cause is firewood.
      </p>
      <p>Among the four facts such as Lakkhana, the main fact is Lakkhana. When it is known, that respective ultimate
        reality is known. When Rasa, Paccupatthana, and Padatthana are also known, that respective ultimate reality is
        known very well. Therefore, in introducing ultimate realities in commentaries, the four facts such as Lakkhana
        are shown for every formation.</p>
      <p>Among the seven purifications, the two purifications of Sila and Citta are the ground of Vipassana. The five
        purifications starting with Ditthi Visuddhi are the body of Vipassana. The yogi who has developed the two root
        purifications should then try to discern Nama and Rupa to develop Ditthi Visuddhi. It should be done by
        meditation itself. Samatha Yanikas should start discerning Nama and Rupa based on the Jhana they have obtained.
        The Vipassana Yanika should first find the Rupa group based on parts such as hair and then find the Nama group.
        Discerning Nama and Rupa is done by some yogis by the brief method and by some yogis by the detailed method.</p>
      <p>The yogi who does it briefly: examines the group of internal dhammas considered as 'I', 'being', 'person', sees
        the group of dhammas having the characteristic of bending, and separates this group of dhammas in the mind as
        Nama. Seeing the group of dhammas having the characteristic of being deformed (ruppana), he separates this group
        of dhammas in the mind as Rupa. He knows that Nama is only Nama and not Rupa, Rupa is only Rupa and not Nama,
        Nama is only Nama and not a being - not I, Rupa is only Rupa and not a being - not I, and apart from these two
        groups of Nama and Rupa which are not a being or person, there is no 'I' who does merit and demerit and
        experiences happiness and suffering, nor a human, nor a god, nor anyone else among this group of Nama and Rupa.
        Thus, knowing the two Nama and Rupa well is discerning Nama and Rupa briefly.</p>
      <p>In the group of internal dhammas considered as 'I', what is called Nama is the group of Citta and Cetasika.
        They arise in the bases of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and heart. All those dhammas arising in bases arise
        taking some object such as form and sound. They arise as if turning towards the object and looking at the
        object. Bending is the nature of being inclined towards the object. The characteristic of bending is that
        nature. In the Rupas which are the places for the arising of Nama dhammas, there is no nature of pulling or
        bending towards that object. Therefore, they are not Nama. They undergo change due to cold and heat etc. Ruppana
        is undergoing that change. The characteristic of Rupa is undergoing change due to cold and heat etc.</p>
      <p>The person with excessive wisdom is able to remove Sakkaya Ditthi along with Sanna, Citta, and Ditthi
        Vipallasas by discerning Nama and Rupa briefly itself. Taking Nama and Rupa dhammas which are not self as self
        is <b>Ditthi Vipallasa</b>. By faith in the Buddha and accepting the Dhamma, Ditthi Vipallasa is suppressed. The
        abandonment of the two Sanna and Citta Vipallasas does not happen by any other method than discerning Nama and
        Rupa. Until the knowledge of Nama and Rupa is purified, Sanna and Citta Vipallasas are not abandoned. As long as
        those two exist, the knowledge of Nama and Rupa is not purified.</p>
      <p>The person who discerns Nama and Rupa in detail discerns Nama and Rupa by methods such as aggregates, elements,
        and bases. The knowledge of Nama and Rupa dhammas should be developed until the Sanna, Citta, and Ditthi
        Vipallasas that there is a self are removed.</p>
      <p>For the yogi who has known Nama and Rupa well, by seeing that there is nothing else other than Nama and Rupa,
        the view that "There is a self inside the body engaging Nama and Rupa in respective works; that self performs
        all actions - experiences happiness and suffering - goes from birth to birth" is removed. By seeing that neither
        Nama nor Rupa can perform any action individually, the view taking Nama alone or Rupa alone or both as self is
        removed.</p>
