      <p>Cittas that do not have the nature of producing results (Vipaka) and are not results of any Kamma are called
        Kriya Cittas (Functional Consciousness). It is the nature of every Citta to perform some function. Since the
        Cittas that produce results are called Kusala and Akusala, and the Cittas produced by them are called Vipaka,
        the remaining group of Cittas are called Kriya because they arise merely performing their respective functions.
        Names have been given to Ahetuka Kriya Cittas according to the functions performed by them.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Upekkha-sahagata Pancadvaravajjana (Five-Sense-Door Adverting Consciousness associated with Neutral
            Feeling)</b></li>
        <li><b>Upekkha-sahagata Manodvaravajjana (Mind-Door Adverting Consciousness associated with Neutral Feeling)</b>
        </li>
        <li><b>Somanassa-sahagata Hasituppada (Smile-producing Consciousness associated with Joy)</b></li>
      </ol>
      <p>These are the three Ahetuka Kriya Cittas.</p>
      <p>The places where Cittas arise, namely eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body, are also called doors (Dvara). Objects
        such as forms enter the mental continuum through those doors. The Bhavanga Citta (Life-continuum Consciousness),
        which is the natural consciousness of the being, and many other Cittas arise in the heart chamber (Hadaya). The
        stream of Bhavanga Cittas existing in the heart chamber is called the Mind Door (Manodvara). Various Cittas
        regarding various matters arise emerging from the Bhavanga Citta existing in the heart chamber.</p>
      <p>If an object comes to any of the five doors such as the eye, that object immediately strikes the Mind Door as
        well. Thereby, the arising of Bhavanga Cittas stops, and a Citta arises knowing that an object has struck a
        door. Since it is an adverting (turning towards) to the object that struck the five doors, that Citta is called
        Pancadvaravajjana. Objects also come directly to the Mind Door without striking the five doors. The Citta that
        arises first regarding such objects is called <b>Manodvaravajjana</b>.</p>
      <p><b>Pancadvaravajjana</b> is the Citta that adverts to the objects coming to the five doors.
        <b>Manodvaravajjana</b> is the Citta that first adverts to the object coming to the Mind Door. (An understanding
        of these two Cittas can be gained when learning the Vithi section. For now, generally remember only the two
        Cittas.)
      </p>
      <p>Hasituppada Citta is the Citta that produces laughter. There are other Cittas that produce laughter. This
        Ahetuka Kriya Citta is one of them. Other Cittas that produce laughter perform not only laughter but also other
        things. This Citta performs only laughter. Therefore, it is named Hasituppada.</p>
      <p>Apart from these three Ahetuka Kriya Cittas, seventeen (17) other Kriya Cittas will be mentioned later. All
        Kriya Cittas are twenty (20). Out of those Cittas, except for the two Pancadvaravajjana and Manodvaravajjana,
        the remaining eighteen (18) Kriya Cittas arise only in Arahants. This Hasituppada Citta is also a Citta that
        arises only in Arahants. Arahants do not laugh aloud like ordinary people. In the science of rhetoric (Alankara
        Shastra), it is shown that laughter is of six types. <b>Sita, Hasita, Vihasita, Upahasita, Apahasita,
          Atihasita</b> are the names of the six types of laughter.</p>
      <p>The laughter where only the eyes open slightly to show joy to an onlooker is called <b>Sita</b>. The laughter
        where the tips of the teeth are visible without sound is called <b>Hasita</b>. Noble persons like Buddhas and
        Pacceka Buddhas laugh in these two ways. They do not laugh making sounds.</p>
      <p>The laughter where a sweet sound is made is called <b>Vihasita</b>. The laughter where the head and shoulders
        shake is called <b>Upahasita</b>. Virtuous ordinary people (Kalyana Puthujjana) and Trainees (Sekhas) laugh in
        these two ways. They do not laugh making loud noises.</p>
      <p>The laughter where tears flow from the eyes is called <b>Apahasita</b>. The laughter done shaking and wriggling
        the whole body is called <b>Atihasita</b>. Those with base ideas who have not developed virtues laugh in these
        two ways. The Hasituppada Citta produces only Sita and Hasita.</p>
      <p>There are eighteen Ahetuka Cittas: seven Akusala Vipaka Cittas, eight Kusala Vipaka Cittas, and three Kriya
        Cittas. Since Ahetuka Cittas are a weak group, no distinction of Sankhara (prompting) is shown for them in the
        Abhidhamma Pali. When counting Cittas, all eighteen Ahetuka Cittas are counted as <b>Asankharika</b> Cittas.</p>
      <p>In the eighteen Ahetuka Cittas, there are two Somanassa-sahagata Cittas. There are fourteen (14)
        Upekkha-sahagata Cittas. There is one Sukha-sahagata Citta. There is one Dukkha-sahagata Citta.</p>
      <p>The thirty Cittas comprising the twelve (12) Akusala Cittas and the eighteen (18) Ahetuka Cittas are called
        <b>Asobhana</b> (Non-beautiful) Cittas. The fifty-nine (59) Cittas in one method and ninety-one (91) Cittas in
        another method which will be mentioned later are called <b>Sobhana</b> (Beautiful) Cittas.
