      <p><b>Phassa, Vedana, Sanna, Cetana, Ekaggata, Jivitindriya, and Manasikara</b> are the seven Sabbacittasadharana
        Cetasikas.</p>
      <p>These seven Cetasikas are necessary for every Citta to arise. Since they apply to all Cittas without
        distinction such as Kusala, Akusala etc., these seven Cetasikas are called "Sabbacittasadharana" (Universal to
        all Cittas).</p>
      <p><b>Phassa</b></p>
      <p>The nature of touching the object is called Phassa. Touching means coming close so that there is no gap. It is
        also called contact. One who gropes in the dark can only know what touches the hand. Similarly, the mind also
        feels only what touches the mind. Therefore, for a Citta or knowing to occur, there must be a contact with the
        knowable. Since there cannot be knowing without contact, it should be known that this "Phassa Cetasika" is a
        necessary factor for all Cittas. This Phassa regarding the mind is not a contact like two physical objects
        touching together, but a certain subtle nature called by the name contact. It is a Cetasika difficult to
        understand.</p>
      <p><b>Vedana</b></p>
      <p>The nature of experiencing the taste of the object as good, bad, or neutral is called Vedana. What was
        mentioned in the Citta chapter by the names Somanassa, Domanassa, Upekkha, Sukha, Dukkha is this Vedana
        Cetasika.</p>
      <p><b>Sanna</b></p>
      <p>The nature of taking the mode of the object is called Sanna. Every object has a special mode that helps to
        recognize it separately from other things. When a Citta arises taking an object, the Sanna Cetasika taking the
        mode of the object also arises with that Citta at all times. That Sanna is a recognition of that thing according
        to previous Sannas, and also a marking for future recognition. Since taking the mode of the object is also a
        recognition, many books also say "Sanna is the nature of recognizing objects".</p>
      <p><b>Cetana</b></p>
      <p>The effort to perform actions such as looking, hearing, eating, drinking, going, coming, giving, taking etc. is
        called Cetana. There are immeasurable actions performed by beings. The effort to perform every such action is
        the Cetana Cetasika. There are immeasurable Cetanas such as Panatipata Cetana, Adinnadana Cetana, Dana Cetana
        etc. All of them are considered as Cetana Cetasika by the state of Cetana.</p>
      <p>When an effort to perform a certain action arises, a Citta also arises in accordance with it. A group of
        Cetasikas necessary to perform that action also arises bound with it according to the Cetana. Cetana is the
        chief of all of them. Therefore, it is also said that "Cetana is like a commander". Every Citta arises as
        performing a certain action. Therefore, there is a Cetana in every Citta. In performing actions, Cetana is
        chief. In taking objects, Citta is chief. What is called "Karma" is also this Cetana Cetasika.</p>
      <p><b>Ekaggata</b></p>
      <p>The nature of placing the mind well on the object so that it does not shake is called Ekaggata. Even in a
        single object, there are various modes that the mind can take and consider. When looking at an object from one
        place, it appears in one way. If looking from another place, the same object appears in another way. Thus, if
        looking from a hundred places, the same object appears in a hundred ways. All those appearing modes are modes
        that the mind can take of that object.</p>
      <p>When taking a thing by the mind, that object must be taken by one of those many modes in the object. A single
        Citta cannot take a single object by several modes at once. For the Citta to be able to take the object, it must
        be established in one mode of the object. What is done by Ekaggata is establishing in a certain one mode of the
        object. Because of that establishing, the Citta can take the object in one mode. Since objects have many modes,
        a Citta cannot take an object without Ekaggata. Therefore, Ekaggata is necessary for every Citta. "Samadhi" is
        another name for Ekaggata Cetasika. That name is mostly used for developed Ekaggata.</p>
      <p><b>Jivitindriya</b></p>
      <p>The life force - the strength of living - of Citta and Cetasikas is called "Jivitindriya". The body exists for
        a long time without falling due to the support of food and drink. There is nothing taken from outside that helps
        the existence of the mind. However, there must be something that helps the existence of the mental stream.
        Without such a thing, this mental stream cannot exist without being cut off until attaining Nibbana. The thing
        that helps the existence of the being's mental stream until attaining Nibbana, and governs it, is this
        Jivitindriya Cetasika. Due to the governance done by it, the mental stream exists until Parinibbana without
        being cut off even by death.</p>
      <p><b>Manasikara</b></p>
      <p>The phenomenon that directs the mind in taking objects again and again without letting the mind move away from
        the object is called Manasikara. It is said that the mental stream, which breaks and moves away from the object
        every moment starting from Patisandhi, engages in taking objects arising again and again because of this
        Cetasika. This is an obscure Cetasika difficult to understand.</p>
