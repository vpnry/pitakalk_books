        <h2>5. The Fifty-Four Kamavacara Cittas</h2><i class="material-icons share-icon" file-name="2-5.html">share</i>
      </div>
      <p>There are fifty-four Kamavacara Cittas: twelve Akusala Cittas, eighteen Ahetuka Cittas, and twenty-four
        Kamavacara Sobhana Cittas.</p>
      <p><b>Akusala Cittas (Unwholesome Consciousness)</b></p>
      <p>Cittas which, if they arise in a person's mind, produce unpleasant results for him in the future are called
        Akusala Cittas.</p>
      <p>There are three Akusala Roots: Lobha (Greed), Dosa (Hatred), and Moha (Delusion). These three are three
        Cetasikas. The Akusala Citta, which is generally one, is divided into three based on the association with
        qualities like Lobha: Lobhamula Citta, Dosamula Citta, and Mohamula Citta.</p>
      <p><b>The Eight Lobhamula Cittas</b></p>
      <p>Lobha is the nature of attachment to various things and persons, thinking "this is good, beautiful, sweet".
        Desire, want, lust, greed, attachment, affection, love are words that refer to Lobha itself. The Citta
        associated with that Lobha is further divided into two: Somanassa-sahagata Citta (Citta accompanied by pleasure)
        and Upekkha-sahagata Citta (Citta accompanied by equanimity).</p>
      <p>It has been stated above that Citta is the knowing of something. In this Dhamma, the thing that is felt by the
        Citta is called Arammana (Object). Since one Citta is known by another Citta, Citta is also an object. Every
        object has one of three qualities: goodness, badness, or neutrality. These qualities are called the 'taste' of
        the object. If a Citta arises taking any object, a nature that enjoys or experiences the taste of that object
        arises bound with that Citta. The nature arising with the Citta that experiences the sweetness of the object is
        called Somanassa Vedana (Pleasant Feeling). The nature that experiences the neutrality of the object is called
        Upekkha Vedana (Neutral Feeling). The nature that experiences the badness of the object is called Domanassa
        Vedana (Unpleasant Feeling). <b>Lobha-sahagata Citta is never associated with Domanassa Vedana.</b> When a
        Lobhamula Citta arises, it arises with the experiencing of either the goodness or the neutrality of the object.
      </p>
      <p>The Lobhamula Citta is divided into two as <b>Somanassa-sahagata Citta</b> and <b>Upekkha-sahagata Citta</b>
        based on the two factors: experiencing the goodness of the object and experiencing the neutrality of the object.
        Somanassa-sahagata Citta is the Citta associated with Somanassa Vedana. Upekkha-sahagata Citta is the Citta
        associated with Upekkha Vedana. Happiness is another name used for Somanassa Vedana.</p>
      <p>Each of these two Cittas is again divided into two. That is as follows: Sometimes this Lobhamula
        Somanassa-sahagata Citta is associated with the wrong view that "there is no such thing as merit and sin, there
        is no result of merit and sin, there is no other world, there is no fault in doing anything". Sometimes it is
        not associated with wrong view. View is also called Ditthi. Based on the two factors of being associated with
        view or not, the Somanassa-sahagata Citta from the two Lobhamula Cittas mentioned above is divided into two as
        <b>Somanassa-sahagata Ditthigata-sampayutta Citta</b> and <b>Somanassa-sahagata Ditthigata-vippayutta Citta</b>.
        Similarly, the Upekkha-sahagata Citta is divided into two as <b>Upekkha-sahagata Ditthigata-sampayutta Citta</b>
        and <b>Upekkha-sahagata Ditthigata-vippayutta Citta</b>. By this division, there are four Lobhamula Cittas.
      </p>
      <p>The first of those four Cittas, the Somanassa-sahagata Ditthigata-sampayutta Citta, is again divided into two.
        That is as follows: Sometimes that Citta arises naturally. Sometimes it arises due to the inducement of others
        or by one's own effort or by the effort of others. The Citta that arises without inducement or effort is called
        Asankharika Citta. The Citta that arises with inducement or effort is called Sasankharika Citta. The remaining
        three Cittas are also divided into two each based on the Sankhara distinction. When divided thus, there are
        eight Lobhamula Cittas. Those eight Cittas are as follows:</p>
