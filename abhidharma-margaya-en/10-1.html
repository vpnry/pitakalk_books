      <p>The highest result to be obtained by learning and knowing the analysis of Mind and Matter with conditions shown
        in the previous eight chapters is, by basing on that knowledge and engaging in meditation, to eliminate the
        group of defilements headed by ignorance and craving which are the cause of all suffering, to purify one's own
        continuity, and to realize the supramundane Nirvana element. The true nature of extremely deep ultimate
        realities cannot be known only by learning books. Ordinary knowledge not developed by method is not sufficient
        to find and see the true nature of those dharmas correctly. To understand those dharmas correctly, concentration
        and wisdom developed by engaging in meditation are needed. Therefore, to be able to purify the Dhamma knowledge
        obtained by learning, one should engage in meditation. To be able to develop Dhamma knowledge and to realize
        Nirvana, some meditation shown in this chapter should be practiced.</p>
      <p><b>Kammatthana (Meditation Subjects)</b></p>
      <p>Concepts such as Kasina and Mind-Matter dharmas taken as objects for the yoga work done by yogis are called
        <b>Kammatthana</b>. The meaning of the word <b>Kammatthana</b> is: 'It is the place for yoga work'. The yoga
        action or meditation performed initially is also called Kammatthana because it is the foundation for the
        meditation done subsequently. There are two types of Kammatthana: Samatha Kammatthana and Vipassana Kammatthana.
      </p>
      <p>The one-pointedness that calms defilements such as lust and certain gross mental factors such as Vitakka is
        called <b>Samatha</b>. Samadhi is also a name for it. Concepts such as Kasina which are the places for Samadhi
        meditation are called Samatha Kammatthana. The meditation done taking them as objects is also called Samatha
        Kammatthana. The highest thing that can be obtained from Samatha Kammatthana is Jhanas, Abhinnas (Supernormal
        Knowledges), and birth in a happy destiny. That Samadhi is also helpful for Vipassana.</p>
      <p>The wisdom that sees the five aggregates, which ordinary people see as beings, persons, men, women, and as
        permanent things, good things, as a heap of Mind and Matter dharmas, and specially sees them as impermanent
        things, unpleasant things, and sees the five aggregates exactly as they are, is called '<b>Vipassana</b>'. Mind
        and Matter dharmas taken as objects for Vipassana and Vipassana meditations are called Vipassana Kammatthana. It
        is by Vipassana Kammatthana that the being is led to Nirvana by giving supramundane Paths and Fruits.</p>
      <p><b>Forty Samatha Kammatthanas</b></p>
      <p>There are forty Samatha Kammatthanas: Ten Kasinas, Ten Asubhas, Ten Anussatis, Four Appamannas, One Sanna, One
        Vavatthana, and Four Aruppas.</p>
      <p><b>Ten Kasinas</b></p>
      <p>There are ten Kasinas: Pathavi Kasina, Apo Kasina, Tejo Kasina, Vayo Kasina, Nila Kasina, Pita Kasina, Lohita
        Kasina, Odata Kasina, Akasa Kasina, and Aloka Kasina.</p>
      <p>The clay disk taken by yogis for establishing (concentration) is called 'Pathavi Kasina'. When taking any
        Kasina as small, it should be about one span and four inches. When taking as large, it is suitable to take the
        Kasina as large as an umbrella or a threshing floor. For Pathavi Kasina, somewhat red clay should be taken. Very
        red clay or clay of another color should not be taken to make the Kasina. It is suitable to make it by applying
        clay on the ground itself or on something like a plank. The clay should be kneaded well and made smooth without
        cracks. Pathavi disk etc. are called Kasina because they should be meditated upon by taking them as the object
        everywhere during meditation.</p>
      <p>Water situated in a circular shape is 'Apo Kasina'. Water with some strange color should not be taken for Apo
        Kasina. Apo Kasina meditation can be done by filling a vessel with a round mouth like a bowl with clean water.
      </p>
      <p>Fire seen in a circular shape is 'Tejo Kasina'. Having prepared a heap of fire with good firewood, placing a
        sheet with a circular hole of about one span and four inches near that fire, and taking the fire seen through
        that hole as the object, Tejo Kasina meditation can be done.</p>
      <p>The wind column considered by one's own mind according to something struck by wind is 'Vayo Kasina'. Vayo
        Kasina meditation can be done by considering as a wind stream by one's own mind according to something seen
        moving by being struck by wind, or by recalling the wind striking one's body coming through some hole.</p>
      <p>The disk having blue color is 'Nila Kasina'. The disk having yellow color is 'Pita Kasina'. The disk having red
        color is 'Lohita Kasina'. The disk having white color is 'Odata Kasina'. Color Kasinas can be made by applying
        paint of respective colors on something. They can also be made with colored paper and cloth. Cutting a hole of
        about one span and four inches in a thick paper and placing a paper of the desired color underneath it is a very
        easy method of making Color Kasinas.</p>
      <p>The space disk is 'Akasa Kasina'. Akasa Kasina meditation can be done by making a hole of one span and four
        inches in something and attending to the space inside that hole.</p>
      <p>The light disk is 'Aloka Kasina'. Aloka Kasina meditation can be done by making light fall on the ground or on
        a wall etc. about one span and four inches and looking at that light. Aloka Kasina can be made by making a hole
        in a tin, lighting a lamp inside it, and making the light fall on some place through the hole. It can also be
        made with a clay pot. In places with electricity, Aloka Kasina can be made very easily.</p>
      <p><b>Lesson 2</b></p>
      <p><b>Ten Asubhas</b></p>
      <p>There are ten Asubhas: Uddhumataka, Vinilaka, Vipubbaka, Vicchiddaka, Vikkhayitaka, Vikkhittaka,
        Hatavikkhittaka, Lohitaka, Pulavaka, and Atthika.</p>
      <p>The bloated corpse is called <b>Uddhumataka</b>. The corpse that is bloated and turned blue is called
        <b>Vinilaka</b>. The corpse that is festering and oozing pus from various places is called <b>Vipubbaka</b>. The
        corpse cut in two in battlefields etc. is called <b>Vicchiddaka</b>. The corpse eaten here and there by dogs,
        jackals, etc. is called <b>Vikkhayitaka</b>. The corpse torn into pieces and scattered here and there by dogs,
        jackals, etc. is called <b>Vikkhittaka</b>. The corpse injured all over like crow's feet and later cut into
        pieces and scattered is called <b>Hatavikkhittaka</b>. The corpse with flowing blood is called <b>Lohitaka</b>.
        The corpse infested with worms is called <b>Pulavaka</b>. The heap of bones without blood and flesh is called
        <b>Atthika</b>.
      </p>
      <p><b>Ten Anussatis</b></p>
      <p>There are ten Anussati Kammatthanas: Buddhanussati, Dhammanussati, Sanghanussati, Silanussati, Caganussati,
        Devatanussati, Upasamanussati, Marananussati, Kayagatasati, and Anapanasati.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Recollecting the virtues of the Buddha such as Arahant etc. is <b>Buddhanussati</b> Kammatthana.</li>
        <li>Recollecting the virtues of the Dhamma such as Svakkhatata etc. is called <b>Dhammanussati</b>.</li>
        <li>Recollecting the virtues of the Sangha such as Supatipannata etc. is called <b>Sanghanussati</b>.</li>
        <li>Recollecting one's own virtue is called <b>Silanussati</b>.</li>
        <li>Recollecting one's own generosity is called <b>Caganussati</b>.</li>
        <li>Recollecting one's own virtues such as faith etc. which lead to divinity, keeping deities as witnesses, is
          called <b>Devatanussati</b>.</li>
        <li>Recollecting the virtues of Nirvana which is the calming of all suffering is called <b>Upasamanussati</b>.
        </li>
        <li>Recollecting death is called <b>Marananussati</b>.</li>
        <li>Recollecting bodily parts such as hair etc. is called <b>Kayagatasati</b>.</li>
        <li>Recollecting the in-breath and out-breath air is called <b>Anapanasati</b>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Metta, Karuna, Mudita, and Upekkha are the four <b>Appamannas. Brahma Vihara</b> is also a name for them.</p>
      <p>One Sanna is the Ahare Patikkula Sanna (Perception of loathsomeness in food). It is recollecting the
        repulsiveness of food in various ways.</p>
      <p>One Vavatthana is viewing the four elements Earth, Water, Fire, and Air in the body separately by way of
        characteristics etc. It is called "Catudhatu Vavatthana".</p>
      <p>Four Aruppas are the four objects such as the Concept of Space extracted from the Kasina which are the objects
        for the four Arupa Jhanas such as Akasanancayatana.</p>
      <p>Herein, the forty Kammatthanas have been shown briefly.</p>
      <p><b>Three Bhavanas (Meditations)</b></p>
      <p>There are three Bhavanas: Parikamma Bhavana, Upacara Bhavana, and Appana Bhavana.</p>
      <p>The meditation of the yogi who establishes the mind on an object such as a Kasina and practices so that the
        object appears to the mind as if seen by the eye by attending to it again and again is called <b>Parikamma
          Bhavana</b>.</p>
      <p>The meditation from the time of taking the meditation object to the mind and suppressing hindrances such as
        sensual desire until approaching the Appana consciousness is called <b>Upacara Bhavana</b>.</p>
      <p>The meditation that has reached Mahaggata Supramundane state is called <b>Appana Bhavana</b>.</p>
      <p>Vitakka is called Appana because it exists as if entering into the object. Because it exists as the principal
        factor, that name is used for all Mahaggata Supramundane Jhana dharmas.</p>
      <p><b>Three Nimittas (Signs)</b></p>
      <p>There are three Nimittas: Parikamma Nimitta, Uggaha Nimitta, and Patibhaga Nimitta. The meditation sign of the
        yogi who starts meditation first and takes the sign in the earth disk etc. to the mind is called <b>Parikamma
          Nimitta</b>. The meditation sign that starts to appear to the mind as if seen by the eye is called <b>Uggaha
          Nimitta</b>. When dwelling recollecting the Uggaha Nimitta, as the hindrances are further removed, the mind
        becomes purified, and the meditation sign appears to the mind very purely, free from all faults. That very pure
        meditation sign is called <b>Patibhaga Nimitta</b>.</p>
