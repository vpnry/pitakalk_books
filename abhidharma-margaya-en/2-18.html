      <p>It has been stated above that there are five Jhanas such as First Jhana etc. Those Jhanas exist not only in
        Rupavacara Cittas but also in Lokuttara Cittas. Therefore, the name "Jhana Cittas" applies to Lokuttara Cittas.
        For those who have not attained Jhana, Lokuttara Cittas always arise associated with the First Jhana. For those
        who have attained Jhana, Lokuttara Cittas can be associated with the five Jhanas such as First Jhana etc.
        Therefore, the Sotapatti Magga Citta, which was shown as one in the brief method, becomes five-fold by the
        division of Jhana -</p>
      <ol>
        <li>First Jhana Sotapatti Magga Citta</li>
        <li>Second Jhana Sotapatti Magga Citta</li>
        <li>Third Jhana Sotapatti Magga Citta</li>
        <li>Fourth Jhana Sotapatti Magga Citta</li>
        <li>Fifth Jhana Sotapatti Magga Citta</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Thus, there are five Cittas. The three Magga Cittas of Sakadagami, Anagami, and Arahat are also five each in
        the same way. Thus, because each Lokuttara Kusala Citta becomes five by the division of Jhana, there are twenty
        (20) Lokuttara Kusala Cittas. Since the four Phala Cittas also become differentiated by Jhana in the same way,
        there are twenty (20) Lokuttara Vipaka Cittas. Since there are twenty Kusala Cittas and twenty Vipaka Cittas,
        there are forty (40) Lokuttara Cittas in the detailed method.</p>
      <p>In these forty Lokuttara Cittas, there are eight First Jhana Cittas. There are also eight each of Second Jhana
        etc. Since First, Second, Third, and Fourth Jhana Cittas are Somanassa-sahagata, there are thirty-two Lokuttara
        Somanassa-sahagata Cittas. Since Fifth Jhana Cittas are Upekkha-sahagata, there are eight Lokuttara
        Upekkha-sahagata Cittas.</p>
      <p>The twenty-seven (27) Mahaggata Cittas and forty (40) Lokuttara Cittas, making sixty-seven (67) Cittas, are
        Jhana Cittas. Among them, there are eleven (11) First Jhana Cittas. There are eleven each of Second, Third, and
        Fourth Jhana Cittas. There are twenty-three (23) Fifth Jhana Cittas. Find the Cittas belonging to each Jhana.
      </p>
      <p>When counting all Cittas, Lokuttara Cittas, which were shown in two methods as brief and detailed, should be
        counted in one method. In the brief method, there are eighty-nine (89) Cittas. In the detailed method, there are
        one hundred and twenty-one (121). In many places ahead, facts are stated according to the detailed method of
        Cittas. Therefore, the classification of Cittas should be mastered in that method.</p>
      <p>Fifty-four Kamavacara Cittas, fifteen Rupavacara Cittas, twelve Arupavacara Cittas, and forty Lokuttara Cittas
        make one hundred and twenty-one (121) Cittas by the division of planes (Bhumi).</p>
      <p>Twelve Akusala, thirty Kusala Cittas, fifty-two Vipaka, and twenty Kriya make one hundred and twenty-one Cittas
        by the division of class (Jati).</p>
      <p>Sixty-three Somanassa-sahagata Cittas, fifty-five Upekkha-sahagata Cittas, and three Domanassa-sahagata Cittas
        make one hundred and twenty-one Cittas by the division of feeling. Find the Cittas belonging to all these parts.
        If dividing Cittas by Sankhara division, count Mahaggata and Lokuttara Cittas in the Sasankharika side.</p>
