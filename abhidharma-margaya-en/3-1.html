      <p>The phenomena that are associated with the Citta by four facts: arising together with the Citta without being
        before or after, ceasing together with it, taking the very same object taken by the Citta, and arising in the
        very place where the Citta arises, are Cetasikas.</p>
      <p><b>Being associated</b> means mixing in a way that cannot be separated in any way. The four facts such as
        arising together are called "four characteristics of association".</p>
      <p>There are fifty-two Cetasikas. Not all of them arise together with a single Citta at once. Only the Cetasikas
        necessary to perform the function belonging to that Citta arise with a single Citta. There are also Cetasikas
        that are opposed to each other like light and darkness. Mutually opposed Cetasikas never arise together.
        Therefore, all fifty-two Cetasikas cannot arise together bound with a single Citta.</p>
      <p>The maximum number of Cetasikas arising at once with a single Citta is thirty-six. Groups of Cetasikas
        numbering seven, ten, eleven, twelve etc. arise with those respective Cittas.</p>
      <p>A Citta cannot arise without the support of Cetasikas. A Cetasika also cannot arise without the support of a
        Citta. Therefore, the Citta and the group of Cetasikas necessary to perform the function performed by that Citta
        must arise at once without being before or after. That is why arising at once with the Citta was stated as a
        characteristic of Cetasika.</p>
      <p>Just as when the heartwood of a log remains while the sapwood decays and perishes first, it is not that some of
        the phenomena belonging to a single group of Citta and Cetasikas remain while some perish. If one ceases, the
        others cannot exist without ceasing along with it. Therefore, ceasing at once with the Citta was also stated as
        a characteristic of Cetasika.</p>
      <p>Taking the object is the function belonging to the Citta. The only work done by the Citta is taking the object.
        Enjoying the taste of the object, adhering to the object, opposing it etc. are functions belonging to Cetasikas.
        What the Cetasikas arising with a Citta taking a certain object do is enjoying the taste of the object taken by
        that Citta, adhering to that object, opposing that object etc. Therefore, taking the very object taken by the
        Citta was stated as a characteristic of Cetasika.</p>
      <p>There are six places where Cittas arise. If a Citta arises in a certain place, the Cetasikas arising with that
        Citta also arise in that very place associated with that very base. Therefore, arising in the very place where
        the Citta arises was stated as a characteristic of Cetasika.</p>
      <p>There are three groups of Cetasikas namely Annasamana group, Akusala group, and Sobhana group. There are
        thirteen Cetasikas belonging to the Annasamana group, namely seven Sabbacittasadharana Cetasikas and six
        Pakinnaka Cetasikas. There are fourteen Cetasikas belonging to the Akusala group. Twenty-five Cetasikas, namely
        nineteen Sobhana Sadharana Cetasikas, three Virati Cetasikas, two Appamanna Cetasikas, and Panna Cetasika, are
        Cetasikas belonging to the Sobhana group.</p>
      <p><b>Questions</b></p>

        <li>What are the four general characteristics of Cetasikas?</li>
        <li>What is the meaning of being associated?</li>
        <li>Why do all Cetasikas not arise in a single Citta?</li>
        <li>Why can Cetasikas not arise before or after the Citta?</li>
        <li>Do Cetasikas exist after the Citta ceases?</li>
        <li>Can Cetasikas cease before the Citta?</li>
        <li>How many Cetasikas are there?</li>
