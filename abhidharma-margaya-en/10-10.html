      <p>Anapanasati meditation is establishing the mind on the in-breath and out-breath and recollecting it. This is a
        meditation practiced by many yogis both within and outside the Buddha Sasana.</p>
      <p>The person practicing it should sit down and keep the body straight. Then, one should find the place where the
        in-breath and out-breath touches. For some, that air touches the tip of the nose and goes out. For some, it
        touches the tip of the upper lip and goes out. Basing on the place where it touches, one should try to recollect
        the air so that the beginning, middle, and end of the in-breath and out-breath are all seen. The beginning of
        the in-breath is the tip of the nose. The middle is the chest. The end is the navel. Try to see the air stream
        traveling from the tip of the nose to the navel. The beginning of the out-breath is the navel. The middle is the
        chest. The end is the tip of the nose. One should not try to find the part of the air that has gone out of the
        body.</p>
      <p>The person doing this meditation should try to maintain the in-breath and out-breath as it happens naturally.
        If one tries to breathe in and out with effort, one will get tired in a short time and may reach a state where
        meditation cannot be done. Doing so may sometimes cause ailments in the stomach and chest. Meditate by counting
        the in-breaths and out-breaths for some time. When counting, do not count continuously but count up to ten. When
        reached ten, stop counting further and count from one again. After concentration has developed to some extent,
        stop counting and recollect only the air so that the beginning, middle, and end are all seen. If done properly
        and well, all five Jhanas can be obtained from this meditation. Even if done to some extent, mindfulness and
        wisdom will develop from this meditation. Many benefits are obtained.</p>
