      <p><b>Lesson 9</b></p>
      <p>(Since it is inappropriate to describe all meditation subjects in such a book, only Samatha meditation subjects
        that can be useful to everyone will be described.)</p>
      <p>There are two methods of practicing Buddhanussati meditation. One is recollecting the form of the Buddha. It is
        done thus:- First, go to a Buddha statue that you like and think is good, and look at the Buddha statue so that
        it is well imprinted in the mind. You should look at and take into mind every part of the Buddha statue
        separately from head to feet. You should look at the Buddha statue without blinking as much as possible. When
        done so for a few days, the Buddha statue will be imprinted in the mind. After that, sit in a secluded place,
        close your eyes, imagine that the Buddha is present in front of you, and recollect the body of that Buddha. When
        recollecting, if you can recollect the complete Buddha statue, if it is clear to the mind, recollect so. If the
        complete Buddha statue is not clear, recollect the head, forehead, eyebrows, eyes, nose, lips, cheeks, chin,
        neck, shoulders, arms, chest, abdomen, waist, knees, and feet separately in order. Also recollect the complete
        form. When practicing thus, for some, the Buddha form will be able to be recollected clearly in a short time. It
        will appear as if the Buddha is present in front of oneself. By establishing the mind on that Buddha form, a
        certain concentration can be obtained. By taking the Buddha form as the object, immense Buddhalambana Piti can
        be generated.</p>
      <p>The other method of practicing Buddhanussati meditation is recollecting the virtues of the Buddha. Buddha
        virtues are very many. Recollecting all of them is an impossible task. The person who wishes to practice
        Buddhanussati meditation should select one Buddha virtue or three or four or seven or eight that are well
        understood by his mind and meditate by recollecting them. The person who wishes to practice this meditation
        should approach a shrine room or near a stupa or near a Bodhi tree or another secluded place, sit down, close
        eyes, keep the body still, and recollect as shown below.</p>
      <p>“My Blessed Buddha has known all things belonging to the three times: past, future, and present exactly as they
        are without error. There is nothing he does not know.</p>
      <p>My Blessed Buddha has known the causes of all things exactly as they are, that this thing arises due to this
        cause, happens due to this cause.</p>
      <p>My Blessed Buddha was Greatly Compassionate. He was compassionate towards his own son Prince Rahula and towards
        arch-enemies like Devadatta without difference.</p>
      <p>My Blessed Buddha underwent immeasurable suffering for four Asankhyas and a hundred thousand Kalpas to liberate
        this multitude of beings from suffering. There is no sacrifice he did not make to liberate these beings from
        Samsaric suffering.</p>
      <p>He showed the path to the people of the world to obtain human and divine happiness and the happiness of
        Nibbana.</p>
      <p>He is supreme in the world because he lives pure having destroyed all defilements by the Arahant Path
        Knowledge, and because he is endowed with great Buddha power that subdues even the power of devas and brahmas.
        There is no one in the world equal to him in virtue and Iddhi power.</p>
      <p>“He is worthy of receiving respect and homage from all world beings including devas.”</p>
      <p>Recollect Buddha virtues thus. Here, only a few Buddha virtues that can be easily understood and comprehended
        are shown. Buddhanussati meditation does not happen by memorizing and reciting things found in books about
        Buddha virtues that one does not understand.</p>
