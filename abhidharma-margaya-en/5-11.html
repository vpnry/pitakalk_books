      <p>It is clear that Pancadvara Vithis arise by the striking of objects like Rupa on doors like Cakkhu. The causes
        for the arising of Manodvara Vithis are not clear. Therefore, they are shown.</p>
      <p>There are many causes for the arising of Manodvara Vithis. The striking of objects like Rupa on Pancadvara is
        also one cause for the arising of Manodvara Vithis. Being connected to objects taken by Pancadvara, hearing
        others speak, being connected to what was heard, being asked questions by others, thinking, bodily Dhatu
        disturbance, hunger - thirst, arising of various bodily pains, meeting enemies, meeting friends; these are a
        part of the causes for the arising of Manodvara Vithis.</p>
      <p>When a bell is struck once, a loud sound arises. After that, without a striking, a series of sounds arises
        gradually becoming finer due to the sound that arose initially. Similarly, when a Ruparammana strikes the Cakkhu
        Pasada once, after a Cakkhudvara Vithi arises and ceases, because that Ruparammana comes to the Manodvara,
        sometimes hundreds and thousands of Manodvara Vithis arise. Similarly, after Sota Ghana Jivha Kaya Dvara Vithis,
        because objects like Sadda are directed to the Manodvara, hundreds and thousands of Manodvara Vithis arise.</p>
      <p>When Pancadvaras take an object once, many Manodvara Vithis arise because many objects connected to that object
        by way of similarity are also directed to the Manodvara.</p>
      <p>Innumerable Manodvara Vithis arise by hearing what others say, such as "There is such a thing in such a place",
        "So-and-so did such a thing", "Such a thing happened in such a place in such a country". Similarly, innumerable
        Manodvara Vithis arise due to reading books.</p>
      <p>Many Manodvara Vithis arise because many other facts are directed to the Manodvara due to the connection with
        facts known by hearing from others or reading books.</p>
      <p>Many Manodvara Vithis arise because many facts connected to those questions are directed to the Manodvara due
        to questions asked by others.</p>
      <p>"Thinking" is directing one's mind towards unknown facts. Many Manodvara Vithis arise because many objects are
        directed to the Manodvara due to thinking.</p>
      <p>It should be understood that often many Manodvara Vithis arise due to Dhatu disturbance etc. Sometimes various
        objects are given to the minds of humans by Bhutas (spirits). It should be known that many Manodvara Vithis
        arise due to that also.</p>
      <p><b>Anubandhaka Manodvara Vithis.</b></p>
      <p>Just because a Rupa struck the Cakkhu Pasada and a Cakkhudvara Vithi arose, the feeling "I saw such a thing"
        does not arise in that person. For the feeling "I saw such a thing" to arise in the person, a number of
        Manodvara Vithis must arise after the Cakkhudvara Vithi. Only the color struck on the Cakkhu Pasada is felt to
        the Cakkhudvara Vithi. Just because Sota, Ghana, Jivha, Kaya Dvara Vithis arose, the person does not feel "Such
        a thing was heard", "Such a smell - such a taste - was felt", "Such a thing was touched". For knowledge about
        them to arise, a number of Manodvara Vithis must arise. Manodvara Vithis arising regarding the objects taken by
        those Vithis following Pancadvara Vithis are called Anubandhaka Manodvara Vithis. What arise as Anubandhaka
        Manodvara Vithis are also the aforementioned Vibhutarammana Avibhutarammana Vithis not having seventeen Citta
        Khanas. The method in which Anubandhaka Manodvara Vithis arise following Pancadvara Vithis is stated in several
        ways in several books.</p>
      <p>When a Rupa strikes the Cakkhu Pasada, first a Cakkhudvara Vithi arises. After it ceases, a Manodvara Vithi
        arises taking the past Rupa taken by the Cakkhudvara Vithi. After that, a Manodvara Vithi arises taking the name
        said for that Rupa as object. After it ceases, a Manodvara Vithi arises taking the thing denoted by that name or
        the meaning of the word. The knowledge "I saw such a thing" arises in the person after the arising of the third
        Manodvara Vithi.</p>
      <p>When a sound comes to the Sota Dvara, first a Sotavinnana Vithi arises. After it ceases, a Manodvara Vithi
        arises taking the past sound again. After it ceases, a Manodvara Vithi arises bringing up its name. According to
        Ghana, Jivha, Kaya Dvara Vithis also, three Manodvara Vithis each arise in this manner. This is a certain
        teacher's opinion.</p>
      <p><b>A Special Fact</b></p>
      <p>In many Abhidharma books, Maranasanna Vithis and Appana Vithis are shown in the fourth chapter itself. It is
        easy to learn Maranasanna Vithis in the Maranuppatti Catushka of the fifth chapter. A good knowledge about
        Appana Vithis can be obtained by learning them together with Kammatthana. Therefore, we will show Maranasanna
        Vithis and Appana Vithis in those places.</p>
