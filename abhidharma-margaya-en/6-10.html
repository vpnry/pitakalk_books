      <p>There are four kinds of death: Ayukkhaya Marana (Death due to expiration of life-span), Kammakkhaya Marana
        (Death due to expiration of Kamma), Ubhayakkhaya Marana (Death due to expiration of both), and Upacchedaka
        Marana (Destructive Death). The life of every being ends by reaching one of these four deaths.</p>
      <p><b>Ayukkhaya Marana</b></p>
      <p>Each species of beings has a specific life-span. The life-span of some species is very short, a few days. The
        life-span of some species is a few weeks. Some, a few months. Some, a few years. When Kusala Mulas grow in
        humans, their life-span increases. When Akusala Mulas grow, the life-span decreases. The determination of
        life-span depends on the condition of parents' bodies, food consumed, and climate.</p>
      <p>The growth and decay of bodies of beings belonging to species that do not have a life-span of a week happen
        within a week. Therefore, they do not live more than a week. The growth and decay of bodies of beings belonging
        to species that have a life-span of a hundred years happen within a hundred years. They cannot live beyond a
        hundred years. Even if a person is born among humans whose life-span is a hundred years due to a Kamma capable
        of making one live for a thousand years, that person cannot live more than a hundred years. Why? Because the
        body which supports life decays in a hundred years. It is said that those who have Kamma energy can live longer
        than the life-span by the power of Iddhi and Rasayana medicines. The death that occurs by the expiration of the
        fixed life-span is called Ayukkhaya Marana.</p>
      <p><b>Kammakkhaya Marana</b></p>
      <p>Some weak Kamma is capable of producing Patisandhi, but is not capable of making the person born of that Kamma
        live until the end of the life-span. Those born of such Kammas die before the expiration of the life-span. That
        death which occurs due to the exhaustion of Kamma energy is called Kammakkhaya Marana.</p>
      <p><b>Ubhayakkhaya Marana</b></p>
      <p>The death that occurs due to the expiration of both life-span and Kamma energy at the same time is called
        Ubhayakkhaya Marana. It is rare for both life and Kamma to expire at the same time for a being.</p>
      <p><b>Upacchedaka Marana</b></p>
      <p>The death that is caused by a Pranaghata Kamma done in past lives or a sinful Kamma done in the present life,
        by creating dangers like diseases etc. while both life-span and Kamma energy still remain, is called Upacchedaka
        Marana.</p>
      <p>Upacchedaka Marana is untimely death (Akala Marana). It is caused not only by Kamma but also by many other
        causes. Life is very weak. Kamma is also weak. If the help of food and drink is not received, if protection is
        not provided, life cannot be maintained only by Kamma energy. Life exists amidst danger. There are many
        life-destroying causes inside the body itself. Outside the body too, life-destroying causes are full around the
        being. Untimely death can occur from any of them.</p>
      <p>Venerable <b>Nagasena</b> Thero has preached eight causes of untimely death to King Milinda. <b>Wind-born
          illness, bile-born illness, phlegm-born illness, illness born of a combination of humors, change of seasons,
          improper care of the body, external attacks (Upakrama), and Kamma Vipaka</b> are those eight causes.</p>
      <p>Illness born of a combination of humors (Sannipata) is the illness arising from two or all three Doshas.</p>
      <p>Change of seasons (Rtu Viparyasa) is the fluctuation of heat and cold. Deaths caused by getting caught in
        floods submerging villages due to heavy rains, and deaths caused by various diseases arising from lack of rain
        and lack of food and water are deaths due to change of seasons.</p>
      <p>Deaths caused by being run over by vehicles, getting caught in fire, falling into water etc. due to
        carelessness are deaths due to improper care of the body.</p>
      <p>Death by Upakrama happens in two ways: by one's own Upakrama and by others' Upakrama. Some die by drinking
        poison, hanging themselves, jumping into water, placing the neck on the railway track etc. That is death by
        one's own Upakrama. Deaths caused by snakes, fierce beasts, non-humans, war, thieves, enemies, and kings are
        deaths by others' Upakrama (Paropakrama).</p>
      <p>Some die due to Pranaghata Kammas done in past lives and also due to Kammas done in the present life itself.
        That is death by Kamma Vipaka. It is a wrong view to take that everything happens due to Kamma. Kamma also
        causes death by provoking wind etc. Therefore, if someone dies untimely, it cannot be known whether it happened
        due to a Kamma or due to another cause alone.</p>
