        <li>Conditioned by formations, consciousness arises,</li>
        <li>Conditioned by consciousness, mentality-materiality arises,</li>

        <li>Conditioned by birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair arise.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Thus is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>
      <p>From here onwards, these clauses showing Dependent Origination will be explained in order.</p>
      <p><b>Avijjā paccayā saṅkhārā</b></p>
      <p>Conditioned by ignorance, formations arise.</p>
      <p>Here, ignorance is the delusion that covers the four facts: suffering, the cause of suffering, the cessation of
        suffering, and the path leading to the cessation of suffering which is Nirvana.</p>
      <p>'Formations' (Sankhara) are mundane wholesome and unwholesome volitions. The group of wholesome and unwholesome
        volitions is divided into three parts: meritorious formations (puññābhisankhāra), demeritorious formations
        (apuññābhisankhāra), and imperturbable formations (āneñjābhisankhāra). The eight sense-sphere wholesome
        volitions and the five fine-material sphere wholesome volitions are called meritorious formations. The twelve
        unwholesome volitions are called demeritorious formations. The four immaterial sphere wholesome volitions are
        called imperturbable formations. Since the immaterial sphere wholesome state associated with strong
        concentration is not easily shaken, it is called imperturbable formation. Formations are also threefold as
        bodily formations, verbal formations, and mental formations.</p>
      <p>The person with ignorance, wrongly understanding this Samsara, which is a mass of suffering, as happiness,
        performs various evil deeds to maintain his existence and for gratification. He performs meritorious deeds for
        happiness in future lives. If there were no ignorance, he would not do those merits and demerits. Therefore, it
        is said that formations arise conditioned by ignorance.</p>
      <p>Among these ultimate realities, there is no formation that arises from a single cause. Whatever arises, arises
        from many causes. In this Dependent Origination, only one dharma, ignorance, is shown as the cause of formations
        to indicate the principal cause. In other places too, a single cause is shown to indicate the principal cause.
      </p>
      <p>A question may arise here: how can wholesome states, which are opposed to it, arise from delusion which is
        definitely unwholesome? There is no rule that cause and effect must be similar. From mud that is foul-smelling
        and discolored, a lotus that is fragrant and colorful arises. From fire that is very bright, discolored smoke
        arises. Therefore, it should be accepted that wholesome states can also arise from unwholesome states which are
        opposed to wholesome states.</p>
      <p><b>Saṅkhāra paccayā viññāṇaṃ</b></p>
      <p>Conditioned by formations, consciousness arises.</p>
      <p>The consciousness that arises conditioned by formations is the thirty-two mundane resultant cittas.
        Supramundane resultants are not taken here. Mundane resultants are also of two parts: rebirth resultants and
        life-continuum resultants. Among formations, the volition associated with restlessness (uddhacca) is not a
        condition for rebirth resultants. The direct knowledge (abhinna) volition is not a condition for any resultant
        consciousness. It was stated in the fifth chapter that volition associated with restlessness does not give
        rebirth results. You can know about direct knowledge volition from the section on meditation subjects.</p>
      <p>The arising of resultant consciousness conditioned by formations is a deep point. If these resultant
        consciousnesses arose without kamma, then every resultant consciousness should arise for everyone. Resultant
        consciousnesses related to specific kammas do not arise for others, but only for those who performed those
        kammas. It should be understood from this that if there is no kamma, resultant consciousness does not arise.
        Since resultant consciousnesses arise only when there is kamma, it can be known that kamma is a condition for
        resultant consciousnesses.</p>
      <p><b>Viññāṇa paccayā nāmarūpaṃ</b></p>
      <p>Conditioned by consciousness, mentality-materiality arises.</p>
      <p>The 'mentality' (nama) that arises from the condition of consciousness are the cetasikas that arise associated
        with those respective consciousnesses. The fifty-two cetasikas and the materiality born of the four conditions
        such as kamma are the mentality-materiality that arise from the condition of consciousness. The
        mentality-materiality that can arise due to specific consciousnesses should be understood according to the facts
        stated separately in the previous chapters.</p>
      <p>Only resultant consciousnesses arise from the condition of formations. Wholesome, unwholesome, and functional
        consciousnesses also become conditions for mentality-materiality. Therefore, it should be known that the
        consciousness arising from the condition of formations is resultant consciousness, and the consciousness that is
        a condition for mentality-materiality includes all resultant and non-resultant consciousnesses.</p>
      <p>Rebirth consciousness is a condition only for mentality and kamma-born materiality. Life-continuum
        consciousness is a condition for mentality and all materiality.</p>
      <p>The arising of mentality-materiality from the condition of consciousness should be understood according to the
        planes of existence (bhava). In the sense and fine-material planes, both mentality and materiality arise from
        the condition of consciousness. In the immaterial plane, only mentality arises from the condition of
        consciousness. In the non-percipient plane, there is no consciousness. There, only materiality arises by the
        power of the kamma consciousness belonging to the past life.</p>
      <p>If consciousness does not arise, there is no arising of mentality-materiality. From this, it can be known that
        the arising of mentality-materiality is due to consciousness. Just as when fire arises, light arises from it, it
        should be known that when consciousness arises, mentality-materiality also arises from it.</p>
      <p><b>Nāmarūpa paccayā saḷāyatanaṃ</b></p>
      <p>Conditioned by mentality-materiality, the sixfold base arises.</p>
      <p>It has been stated above that there are twelve bases (ayatanas). Of those twelve bases, the six bases taken
        here are the eye base, ear base, nose base, tongue base, body base, and mind base.</p>
      <p>The word 'nama' refers to the three ultimate realities: citta, cetasika, and Nirvana. Here, 'nama' refers to
        the fifty-two cetasikas. 'Rupa' refers to the eleven materialities belonging to a single continuity: the four
        great elements, the six physical bases, and the life faculty. In some books, twelve materialities are taken
        including nutritive essence.</p>
      <p>The arising of the sixfold base from the condition of mentality-materiality should also be understood
        analytically. Since there is no materiality in the immaterial plane, only the mind base arises there conditioned
        by mentality alone. In the sense plane, all six bases arise conditioned by both mentality and materiality. In
        the fine-material plane, three bases - eye base, ear base, and mind base - arise conditioned by both mentality
        and materiality. In the non-percipient plane, not even one of these six bases arises. The five physical bases
        such as the eye, which belong to the sixfold base, are included in the condition group here because the mind
        base arises due to the physical bases. The arising of the sixfold base is simply the development of
        mentality-materiality. A small fruit does not have a shell, kernel, or water. As it grows, they arise. The
        arising of the sixfold base of mentality-materiality should be understood in the same way.</p>
      <p>Lesson 3</p>
      <p><a id="_Toc503714118"></a><b>Saḷāyatana paccayā phasso</b></p>
      <p>Conditioned by the sixfold base, contact arises.</p>
      <p>Here, 'contact' (phassa) is the contact cetasika. It is sixfold as eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact,
        tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact. By saying contact arises due to the sixfold base, it should not
        be taken that all six contacts arise from all six bases, or that six contacts arise from each base. Only
        eye-contact arises from the eye base. From each base such as the ear, only one contact such as ear-contact
        arises. In the immaterial world, only mind-contact arises. In the fine-material world, three contacts arise. In
        the sense world, all six contacts arise.</p>
      <p>When the six internal bases exist, collision with external bases occurs at some time. If there are no internal
        bases, those collisions never occur. Therefore, the existence of the six bases is the cause for the arising of
        contact.</p>
      <p><b>Phassa paccayā vedanā.</b></p>
      <p>Conditioned by contact, feeling arises.</p>
      <p>Since contact is a universal cetasika, it exists in all cittas. All of them are conditions for feelings.
        However, in this discourse on Dependent Origination, only the contact existing in the thirty-two mundane
        resultant cittas is taken. Although feeling exists in every citta, only the thirty-two mundane resultant
        feelings are taken here.</p>
      <p>If there is contact, feeling will also arise. If there is no contact, feeling will never arise. For feeling to
        arise, there must be contact. Therefore, it is said that conditioned by contact, feeling arises.</p>
      <p><b>Vedanā paccayā taṇhā</b></p>
      <p>Conditioned by feeling, craving arises.</p>
      <p>Here, as the feeling that conditions craving, all eighty-one feelings associated with the eighty-one mundane
        cittas are taken into account. Although craving caused by feeling is generally one, it is sixfold according to
        objects: craving for forms, craving for sounds, craving for smells, craving for tastes, craving for tangibles,
        and craving for mental objects. Since each craving is threefold as craving for sense pleasures, craving for
        existence, and craving for non-existence, there are eighteen cravings. Since they are found in both internal and
        external continuities, there are thirty-six cravings by way of continuity. Since each craving is threefold by
        way of the three times - past, future, and present - there are one hundred and eight cravings.</p>
      <p>Since beings like pleasant feeling, it is obvious that craving arises regarding it. Painful feeling is
        something beings dislike. A question arises here: how does painful feeling, which is a disliked thing, become a
        cause for craving? It is true that beings dislike painful feeling. A being oppressed by painful feeling desires
        happiness. The cause for that was the painful feeling that arose in him. Therefore, it should be understood that
        painful feeling also becomes a cause for craving. Since neutral feeling is peaceful, beings like it too.
        Therefore, all three feelings are taken as causes for craving.</p>
      <p><b>Taṇhā paccayā upādānaṃ</b></p>
      <p>Conditioned by craving, clinging arises.</p>
      <p>It was stated in the seventh chapter that there are four clingings. When taken as dharmas, there are two
        clingings: craving and wrong view. The difference between craving arising conditioned by feeling and
        clinging-craving is as follows: craving arising from the condition of feeling is weak. Clinging-craving arising
        from the condition of craving is strong. Craving arising from the condition of feeling should be understood like
        the craving arising in a gem miner before he finds a gem. Clinging-craving should be understood like the craving
        arising regarding a valuable gem that has come into his hand.</p>
      <p>Craving arises conditioned by feeling for everyone, both Buddhists and non-Buddhists. From craving, clinging to
        sense pleasures arises. Due to craving, clinging to the doctrine of self also arises for everyone, both
        Buddhists and non-Buddhists. Clinging to views and clinging to rites and rituals cannot arise for true
        Buddhists.</p>
      <p>Clinging also arises from the development of craving that arises due to feeling.</p>
      <p><b>Upādāna paccayā bhavo.</b></p>
      <p>Conditioned by clinging, becoming arises.</p>
      <p>There are two becomings arising from the condition of clinging: kamma becoming (kamma bhava) and rebirth
        becoming (upapatti bhava). The group of mundane wholesome and unwholesome volitions is called 'kamma becoming'.
        The group of dharmas consisting of the twelve unwholesome cittas, seventeen mundane wholesome cittas, and
        fifty-two cetasikas is also called 'kamma becoming'. The group of dharmas consisting of the thirty-two mundane
        resultants, the thirty-three cetasikas associated with them, and the twenty kamma-born materialities is called
        'rebirth becoming'.</p>
      <p>Nine rebirth becomings are also shown: sense becoming, fine-material becoming, immaterial becoming, percipient
        becoming, non-percipient becoming, neither-perception-nor-non-perception becoming, one-constituent becoming,
        four-constituent becoming, and five-constituent becoming. Sense becoming etc. are obvious. Non-percipient
        becoming, which has only one aggregate called the materiality aggregate, is called one-constituent becoming.
        Immaterial becoming, which has only the four mental aggregates, is called four-constituent becoming. All
        remaining becomings that have all five aggregates are called five-constituent becoming.</p>
      <p>When clingings have arisen, due to them, one begins to do various things to maintain the five aggregates which
        one takes as 'I' and 'mine', to make them happy, and to obtain the five aggregates in the future. Those things
        done are the kamma becoming arising from the condition of clinging. Rebirth becoming does not arise directly due
        to clinging. It arises due to kamma becoming. The cause of rebirth becoming is kamma becoming. The cause of
        kamma becoming is clinging. Saying that rebirth becoming arises from the condition of clinging is by taking the
        cause producing kamma becoming as the cause of rebirth becoming as well. In the world, the cause of a cause is
        also sometimes spoken of as the cause. 'Rice is cooked with firewood' is such a place. Rice is cooked not by
        firewood but by fire. Firewood is the cause of fire. However, firewood, which is the cause of fire, is spoken of
        as the cause of rice. Saying that rebirth becoming arises from the condition of clinging should also be
        understood in that way.</p>
      <p><b>Bhava paccayā jāti</b></p>
      <p>Conditioned by becoming, birth arises.</p>
      <p>Here, 'birth' refers to the aggregates that first arise for beings in those respective existences. Of the two
        becomings, kamma becoming and rebirth becoming, only kamma becoming is a condition for birth. Therefore,
        although both kamma becoming and rebirth becoming are taken by the word 'bhava' in 'Upādāna paccayā bhavo', only
        kamma becoming should be taken by the word 'bhava' in 'Bhava paccayā jāti'. That kamma becoming is a condition
        for birth can be understood from the differences in beings. Twin children born from the same mother's womb at
        the same time and raised together differ from each other in happiness and suffering etc. because of kamma.</p>
      <p>The 'sankhara' mentioned in 'Avijjā paccayā saṅkhārā' and this 'kamma bhava' are similar as kamma. Three
        existences are connected to this teaching of Dependent Origination. By the name 'sankhara', the past kamma that
        was the cause for the birth of the present existence is expressed. By the name 'kamma bhava', the kamma
        performed in the present existence is expressed.</p>
      <p><b>Jāti paccayā jarā maraṇaṃ soka parideva dukkha domanassupāyāsā sambhavanti.</b></p>
      <p>If birth occurs, aging and death inevitably occur. Sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair also
        occur for many beings. Sorrow etc. occur less for some beings and more for some beings. They do not exist in the
        fine-material and immaterial worlds. Sorrow etc., which do not occur for everyone who has birth, are included
        here and preached to show the evil of the round of rebirths.</p>
      <p>Here, 'aging' is the static phase approaching the dissolution of mentality-materiality. 'Death' is the
        dissolution of mentality-materiality, the destruction. 'Sorrow' is the unpleasant feeling arising due to loss of
        relatives etc. 'Lamentation' is the wailing sound made by those stricken with sorrow due to loss of relatives
        etc. 'Pain' is bodily painful feeling. 'Displeasure' is mental painful feeling. 'Despair' is the great
        exhaustion arising in the mind due to loss of relatives etc. It is the hatred cetasika itself arising in a
        certain way.</p>
