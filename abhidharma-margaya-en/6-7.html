      <p>Thus, there are four Kammas according to the time of giving results. To understand these four Kammas, one must
        understand the nature of Javana Cittas. In a Citta Vithi arising by performing a certain Kusala or Akusala
        action, the Javana Citta performing that action arises seven times in succession. Of them, the first Javana
        Citta is weak. The second Javana Citta becomes powerful by taking the nature of the first Citta. The third
        Javana Citta becomes even more powerful than the second Citta. The fourth Javana Citta becomes even more
        powerful than that. The Cittas arising after the fourth Javana gradually arise with decreasing power one by one.
        Javana Cittas do not arise again after the seventh Javana because of that decrease. Since the first of the seven
        Javana Cittas arises first without the support of a Citta of its own kind, it is the weakest of all. The last
        Javana is also weak. However, since it has received the support of a similar Citta, it is more powerful than the
        first Javana. The five middle Javana Cittas of the Vithi are more powerful than both of them.</p>
      <p><b>Drstadharmavedya Kamma</b></p>
      <p>The Kamma that gives result in the present life is called Drstadharmavedya Kamma. What becomes Drstadharmavedya
        is the first Javana Cetana of the seven Javanas. The weak first Javana Cetana has the power only to produce
        Ahetuka Vipaka in the present existence. The first Javana Cetana does not have the power to produce results
        after death. Only the first Javana Cetanas of very powerful Kusala and Akusala produce results in the present
        existence.</p>
      <p>The Kusala of making offerings with great faith to very virtuous ones gives result in this very world. It has
        been shown that the Dana Kusala endowed with the four accomplishments: Vastu Sampatti, Ksetra Sampatti,
        Adhyasaya Sampatti, and Gunatireka Sampatti gives result in this world. It has been shown that merit gave
        results in the present life itself to <b>Purnaka Setthi, Ekasataka Brahmana, Sumanamalakara</b> etc.</p>
      <p>It is said that the result of those evil deeds was often received in the present existence by those who
        committed crimes against Supreme Buddhas, Pacceka Buddhas, Arahants, and by those who committed crimes against
        great virtuous ones, parents, and friends who helped them. <b>King Kalabu, King Maha Pratapa, Mittavindaka</b>
        etc. received Akusala Vipaka in the present existence itself.</p>
      <p>It is not that the first Javana Cetanas of ordinary Kusala and Akusala do not give results in the present
        existence sometimes. But the person who did the Kamma does not realize it.</p>
      <p><b>Upapadyavedya Kamma</b></p>
      <p>The Kamma that gives result in the existence immediately following the present existence (the second existence)
        is called Upapadyavedaniya Kamma. What becomes Upapadyavedaniya is the last Javana Cetana of the seven Javanas
        in the Vithi. Since it is the last Citta of the falling Javanas, it is very weak. However, since it has received
        Asevana from the sixth Javana, it is slightly more powerful than the first Javana. Therefore, it does not
        produce a result as quickly as the first Javana, but produces Patisandhi and Pavatti Vipaka in the second birth.
        The seventh Javana is not capable of producing a result beyond that.</p>
      <p><b>Aparaparyavedya Kamma</b></p>
      <p>The Kamma that has the power to give results in the period from the third birth until attaining Nibbana is
        called Aparaparyavedya Kamma. What becomes Aparaparyavedya Kamma are the five middle Javanas of the Citta
        Vithis. Since they are powerful, they do not produce results quickly like the first and seventh Javanas, but
        give their result whenever they get an opportunity in the period from the third birth until attaining Nibbana.
        No matter how old it is, even if thousands of Kalpas pass, as long as the person wanders in Samsara,
        Aparaparyavedya Kamma is not destroyed. One Cetana produces Patisandhi Vipaka only once. Pavatti Vipaka is
        produced on various occasions.</p>
      <p><b>Ahosi Kamma</b></p>
      <p>Kammas that never produce a result are called Ahosi Kamma. The first Javana Cetanas that did not get an
        opportunity to give result in the present existence, the seventh Javana Cetanas that did not get an opportunity
        to give result in the second existence, and the middle Javana Cetanas that do not find a place to give result
        are called Ahosi Kamma.</p>
      <p><b>Vipakasthana Kamma Catushka</b></p>
      <p>There are four Kammas according to the places where results are given: <b>Akusala Kamma, Kamavacara Kusala
          Kamma, Rupavacara Kusala Kamma, and Arupavacara Kusala Kamma</b>.</p>
      <p>There are sixteen Kammas in the Abhidharma method as Krtya Kamma Catushka, Pakadana Paryaya Kamma Catushka,
        Pakakala Kamma Catushka, and Pakasthana Kamma Catushka.</p>
