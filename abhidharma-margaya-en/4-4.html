      <p><b>Part I</b></p>
      <p>The places of entry and exit are called “Dvara” (Door). There are places in the bodies of beings where forms
        etc. objects enter the being’s continuity (Santana) and where the mind goes towards forms etc. objects. In this
        Abhidharma, they are introduced by the name Dvara. It is through these doors that streams of Cittas flow towards
        objects like forms. Therefore, one who learns Abhidharma should also know about these doors.</p>
      <p>There are six doors: <b>Cakkhudvara, Sotadvara, Ghanadvara, Jivhadvara, Kayadvara, Manodvara</b>.</p>
      <p>There is a place in the middle of the black pupil of the eye where images of objects in front fall. It is said
        to be the size of a louse’s head. It is also called Cakkhu Pasada. It is also called Cakkhudvara. The falling of
        images of objects in front on it is the entering of the Rupammana (visible object) into the being’s continuity.
        Therefore, the arising of a series of Cittas like Pancadvaravajjana - Cakkhuvinnana - Sampaticchana - Santirana
        etc. regarding the external form is the going of the mind towards the Rupammana from that place. Since the
        entering of Rupammana and the exiting of Cittas happen in this way, Cakkhu Pasada is a door.</p>
      <p>There is a place in the ear where sound strikes - sound is reflected. It is also called Sota Pasada. That Sota
        Pasada is the Sotadvara.</p>
      <p>There is a place in the nose where smells strike causing the arising of Cittas that know smell. It is called
        Ghana Pasada. It is also called Ghanadvara.</p>
      <p>There is a place in the tongue where taste strikes. It is called Jivha Pasada. That Jivha Pasada is the
        Jivhadvara.</p>
      <p>There is a certain subtle matter spread in the body that helps to know touch. It is called Kaya Pasada. It is
        to that Kaya Pasada itself that Kayadvara is called. Details about the five Pasadas can be known in the Rupa
        Chapter.</p>
      <p>The natural Citta called Bhavanga itself is the Manodvara. Manodvara helps to know the five objects form, sound
        etc. that are known in the five doors, and various things that are not objects of the five doors.</p>
      <p><b>Part II</b></p>
      <p>The forty-six Cittas: Pancadvaravajjana, two Cakkhuvinnanas, two Sampaticchanas, three Santiranas, Votthapana
        (Manodvaravajjana) Citta, twenty-nine Kamavacara Javanas, and eleven Tadarammanas are Cittas arising in
        Cakkhudvara.</p>
      <p>Cittas are shown as Pancadvaravajjana etc. according to the order in which Cittas arise in Cakkhudvara. If the
        number of Cittas is added as mentioned, it becomes forty-nine. That is because the three Santiranas are included
        again in Tadarammanas. To get the exact number of Cittas, the Santiranas counted once should be left out and
        counted as eight Tadarammanas. Here eleven Tadarammanas are mentioned because the three Santiranas also arise as
        Tadarammana.</p>
      <p>Of the forty-six Cittas arising in Cakkhudvara, only the two Cakkhuvinnanas arise only there. The remaining
        forty-four Cittas arise in the four doors Sota - Ghana - Jivha - Kaya as well. A part of them arises in
        Manodvara as well.</p>
      <p>Excluding the two Cakkhuvinnanas, the forty-four Cittas arising in Cakkhudvara and the two Sotavinnanas,
        totaling forty-six Cittas, are Cittas arising in Sotadvara.</p>
      <p>The forty-four Cittas mentioned earlier and the two Ghanavinnanas, totaling forty-six Cittas, arise in
        Ghanadvara.</p>
      <p>Forty-six Cittas arise in each of Jivha Dvara and Kaya Dvara as well. The number of Cittas should be taken by
        adding two Jivhavinnanas and two Kayavinnanas to the forty-four Cittas mentioned above. The fifty-four
        Kamavacara Cittas arise in all five doors including Cakkhu etc. Rupavacara - Arupavacara - Lokuttara Cittas do
        not arise in the five doors.</p>
      <p>The sixty-seven Cittas: Manodvaravajjana, fifty-five Javanas, and eleven Tadarammanas arise in Manodvara.</p>
      <p>The nineteen Cittas performing Patisandhi - Bhavanga - Cuti functions are Cittas that do not arise in doors
        because they themselves are the Manodvara. They are Dvaravimutta (Door-freed) Cittas. The remaining seventy
        Cittas are Cittas arising in doors. They are called Dvarika Cittas.</p>
      <p>Among the eighty-nine Cittas, there are Cittas arising in only one door. There are Cittas arising in five
        doors. There are Cittas arising in all six doors. There are Cittas that are sometimes Dvarika and sometimes
        Dvaravimutta. There are Cittas that are always Dvaravimutta.</p>
      <p>The thirty-six Cittas: ten Dvi Panca Vinnanas and twenty-six Mahaggata Lokuttara Javanas are Cittas arising in
        only one door. <b>Manodhatu</b>, which is called Pancadvaravajjana and two Sampaticchanas, are Pancadvarika
        Cittas. The thirty-one Cittas: Somanassa Sahagata Santirana, Manodvaravajjana, and twenty-nine Kama Javanas are
        Cittas arising in all six doors. The ten Cittas: two Upekkha Sahagata Santiranas and eight Mahavipakas are
        sometimes Shad Dvarika (Six-door) and sometimes Dvaravimutta. Those Cittas arise in all six doors by Tadarammana
        function. When arising as Patisandhi - Bhavanga - Cuti functions, they are Dvaravimutta. The nine Mahaggata
        Vipakas are always Dvaravimutta.</p>
