      <p>Since many lay and ordained people who read the Dhamma books compiled by us, and many who conduct Dhamma
        schools and teach in them, have invited us many times to compile an Abhidharma book that is easy to understand,
        learn, and teach, we have compiled this book named <b>Abhidharma Margaya</b>.</p>
      <p>Many places in the existing Abhidharma lesson books have become difficult to understand because Pali passages
        from commentaries have been translated into Sinhala as they are and used in various places in those books. In
        compiling this book named Abhidharma Margaya, we did not follow that method.</p>
      <p>How we have compiled this book is as it occurred to us when thinking about how each fact could be easily
        understood by students. Nothing translated from another language has been used in this book. Here are a few
        examples to understand the difference between this book and other Abhidharma lesson books:-</p>
      <p>In one Abhidharma lesson book, Citta (Consciousness) is introduced among the four ultimate realities of Citta,
        Cetasika, Rupa, Nirvana as follows:-</p>
      <p>“Cintetiti Cittam, it is called Citta because it thinks of the object. In this sense of the word, the nature
        that thinks of objects is called Citta.”</p>
      <p>Another book introduces Citta as follows:</p>
      <p>Citta is what thinks or knows objects. Although there are other causes for the arising of the mind, it should
        be known that knowing the object is its main cause.</p>
      <p><b>In this book, the mind is introduced as follows.</b></p>
      <p>“Among the four ultimate realities, Citta means knowing. It is also called the mind.</p>
      <p>How Cetasika is introduced in one book.</p>
      <p>“Cetasi bhavam cetasikam, that which exists in the mind is Cetasika. In this sense of the word, the group of
        natural phenomena such as Phassa (Contact), Vedana (Feeling) arising in the mind is called Cetasika.”</p>
      <p>How it is in another book.</p>
      <p>“Those that exist in the Citta or are associated with the Citta are Cetasikas.”</p>
      <p><b>Here Cetasikas are introduced as follows.</b></p>
      <p>“When a thought or knowing of an object occurs, other actions that arise mixed with that action of knowing are
        Cetasikas.</p>
      <p>How Rupa is introduced in one book.</p>
      <p>“Ruppatiti Rupam” it is called Rupa because it changes. In this sense of the word, the group of natural
        phenomena that change due to cold, heat etc. is called Rupa.”</p>
      <p>How it is in another book.</p>
      <p>“Rupa is what undergoes change due to cold, heat etc.”</p>
      <p><b>Here Rupa is shown as follows.</b></p>
      <p>“The group of fundamental elements from which the bodies of beings and external objects are made are Rupas.”
      </p>
      <p>How Nirvana is introduced in one book.</p>
      <p>“Vanato nikkhantam nibbanam” the nature that has departed from the craving called Vana is Nibbana. Here Vana is
        craving itself in the sense that it binds and connects small and large existences together.”</p>
      <p>How Nirvana is introduced in another book.</p>
      <p>“Vana is craving. Nirvana is what has departed from that craving known as Vana. Or Nirvana is the extinguishing
        of the fires of lust etc.”</p>
      <p><b>Here Nirvana is introduced as follows.</b></p>
      <p>“Nirvana is the peaceful happy nature free from the fires of defilements such as lust and the fires of
        suffering such as birth, decay, disease, and death.</p>
      <p>All the lessons here have been compiled using words commonly used among the general public as much as possible.
        Uncommon words have been used here only in places where common words could not be found. Therefore, this book
        will be easier to read and understand than other existing books. An energetic person will be able to learn
        Abhidharma from this book even without associating with a teacher.</p>
      <p>Almost all Abhidharma lesson books currently in use have been compiled according to the <b>Abhidhammattha
          Sangaha</b>. This too has been compiled in the same way. However, since this was compiled for the benefit of
        those learning to gain a general knowledge of Abhidharma, certain facts mentioned in the Abhidhammattha Sangaha,
        which do not have much benefit but cause much fatigue to the learner, were not included in this book. Similarly,
        certain facts included in other Abhidharma lesson books which are not of much benefit were also not included in
        this book.</p>
      <p>In some places, useful facts not included in other Abhidharma lesson books have been included in this book.
        Further training in analysis of nature is needed to make it easier when learning Abhidharma treatises. For those
        who do not hope to learn that far, training more in analysis of nature is only a fatigue and not of special
        benefit. Therefore, further analysis of nature was also not included in this book.</p>
      <p><b>This book includes only the facts that should necessarily be known by someone who generally develops
          knowledge of the Dhamma.</b> Therefore, this book does not contain as many facts as other Abhidharma lesson
        books. The book has become large because the included facts have been explained so that they can be easily
        understood. The order of presenting facts in some places here has also been changed from the Abhidhammattha
        Sangaha. Those changes are mostly in the fourth, eighth, and ninth chapters. It has been changed in that way to
        make learning easier. Learning Abhidharma from this book will be somewhat easier than learning Abhidharma from
        another book.</p>
      <p>No matter how simple words are used and how easily the book is compiled for learning, if the learner tries to
        learn in the wrong way without following the method that should be learned, this deep Dhamma cannot be learned.
        <b>The method to learn is to learn in order without missing even a single lesson.</b> One should not proceed
        without gaining knowledge about the initial lessons and initial chapters. Abhidharma lesson books are compiled
        with a connection from lesson to lesson and chapter to chapter. Therefore, a person who cannot understand the
        first chapter cannot learn the second chapter. A person who cannot understand both cannot learn the third
        chapter. A person who cannot understand all three chapters cannot learn the fourth chapter. The method is the
        same until the end.
      </p>
      <p>A person who goes to a higher chapter without knowledge of the initial chapters, without remembering the facts
        of the initial chapters, will get tired of learning as they cannot understand anything in that chapter. Many who
        start learning Abhidharma give up learning after a short time because they go higher without knowing the facts
        of the initial chapters. For those who learn forward by learning the facts of the initial chapters well and
        remembering them, this Dhamma becomes more and more interesting from chapter to chapter. To succeed in learning,
        to receive the knowledge of Dhamma - the taste of Dhamma, learning must be done systematically.</p>
      <p><b>One often hears about the difficulty of teaching Abhidharma lessons in Dhamma schools.</b> Many think that
        teaching has become difficult due to the fault of lesson books. Although there is some truth in that, it is not
        the complete truth. Abhidharma is a very deep science. Even a shallow science can be taught well to another only
        by someone who has a complete knowledge of that science. Teachers with complete knowledge are not to be found in
        Dhamma schools. Therefore, teachers who have learned other subjects have to be used to teach Abhidharma lessons
        in Dhamma schools as well. It is not surprising that teaching Abhidharma lessons is difficult for those
        teachers. It is something that must happen.</p>
      <p>No matter how many weaknesses are in the lesson books, a learned teacher can teach the matter well without
        mistake. The true reason for the difficulty in teaching Abhidharma lessons is the weakness of the teachers.
        Those teachers should be praised for continuing to teach Abhidharma lessons in Dhamma schools even with
        difficulty, without giving up due to difficulties. If teaching Abhidharma is continued in Dhamma schools without
        stopping even with difficulty, those difficulties may disappear over time.</p>
      <p><b>Abhidharma lessons can be taught well only by a teacher who has a complete knowledge of Abhidharma.</b> A
        teacher who has complete knowledge of the Abhidhammattha Sangaha or another such book can also teach Abhidharma
        lessons somewhat well. The teacher teaching Abhidharma lessons should at least know the few lessons before the
        lesson being taught that day in the Abhidharma lesson book. One who does not have even that much knowledge
        cannot teach Abhidharma lessons at all.</p>
      <p><b>A method to easily become an Abhidharma teacher</b></p>
      <p>Teaching is a very good way to improve knowledge. When a lesson is taught to a group of students, the teacher
        gets a higher knowledge than the knowledge received by that group of students. Since this book named
        <b>Abhidharma Margaya</b> is prepared so that it can be easily taught, if a teacher teaches a group of students
        from the beginning, it will be possible to teach without much difficulty. Knowledge will be gained by the
        teacher through teaching itself. If past lessons are forgotten, it will be difficult to teach forward.
        Therefore, past lessons should be read again and again so as not to forget.
      </p>
      <p><b>Without knowledge of past lessons</b>, no benefit can be gained by reading future lessons. One should always
        pay special attention to past lessons without going to look for future lessons. If a difficulty arises for a
        person teaching in this way, it arises in the eighth chapter. If the eighth chapter is written so that it can be
        easily understood, it becomes long in a way not suitable for a lesson book. Therefore, the facts of the eighth
        chapter have been explained to a certain extent. Lack of knowledge of the eighth chapter is not an obstacle to
        learning and teaching the ninth chapter. <b>Everyone can benefit from the ninth chapter here. Meditation methods
          are explained there.</b> If a certain teacher teaches this book two or three times as said, that person will
        effortlessly become a good Abhidharma teacher.</p>
      <p><b>Ultimate realities are very subtle.</b> It is very difficult to write explaining the nature of Dhammas so
        that someone can read and understand. In compiling a lesson book, another difficulty is added to that
        difficulty. If one writes at length using many words, even a very deep fact can be written so that it can be
        understood. There is no room to do so when providing lesson books. When sentences are shortened to the extent
        suitable for a lesson, the matter does not become clear. That is the difficulty in providing lessons. Since it
        is very difficult to write briefly and in a way that the matter can be understood, much more effort had to be
        taken in compiling this book than the effort taken in writing another book. Whether it has been successful or
        not will be known in the future.</p>
      <p>For such a book to be perfectly correct, it should be checked and edited again and again several times. What is
        printed here is our first script. It is not impossible for there to be various shortcomings here. They are best
        seen by the good people who read and teach. If any shortcoming or excess or unclarity or error is seen anywhere
        here, we request everyone to inform us.</p>
