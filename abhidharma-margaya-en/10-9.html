      <p><b>Lesson 10</b></p>
      <p>The meditation done taking body parts such as hair as the object is called Kayagatasati meditation. It is also
        called "Dvattimsakara Bhavana" (Meditation on the Thirty-two Parts) and "Repulsiveness Meditation". In this
        Buddha Sasana, many have become Arahants by this meditation. This is also the very first meditation subject
        given to clansmen who ordain in the Buddha Sasana.</p>
      <p>Hair - Body hair - Nails - Teeth - Skin: Flesh - Sinews - Bones - Bone marrow - Kidney: Heart - Liver -
        Membrane - Spleen - Lungs: Intestines - Mesentery - Undigested food - Feces - Brain: Bile - Phlegm - Pus - Blood
        - Sweat - Fat: Tears - Grease - Saliva - Mucus - Synovial fluid - Urine.</p>
      <p>There are thirty-two parts in this body. The person doing this meditation should understand these thirty-two
        parts well. The color of every part should be known. The shape should be known. The location should be known.
        The direction located should be known. The boundaries of the parts from top, bottom, and across should be known.
        This meditation should be done by reciting aloud. One should not meditate taking all thirty-two parts at once.
        Dividing the thirty-two parts into six groups, one should recite them in forward and reverse order.</p>
      <p>One should recite the first group saying "Hair, Body hair, Nails, Teeth, Skin; Skin, Teeth, Nails, Body hair,
        Hair".</p>
      <p>One should recite the second group saying "Flesh, Sinews, Bones, Bone marrow, Kidney; Kidney, Bone marrow,
        Bones, Sinews, Flesh".</p>
      <p>One should recite the third group saying "Heart, Liver, Membrane, Spleen, Lungs; Lungs, Spleen, Membrane,
        Liver, Heart".</p>
      <p>One should recite the fourth group saying "Intestines, Mesentery, Undigested food, Feces, Brain; Brain, Feces,
        Undigested food, Mesentery, Intestines".</p>
      <p>One should recite the fifth group saying "Bile, Phlegm, Pus, Blood, Sweat, Fat; Fat, Sweat, Blood, Pus, Phlegm,
        Bile".</p>
      <p>One should recite the sixth group saying "Tears, Grease, Saliva, Mucus, Synovial fluid, Urine; Urine, Synovial
        fluid, Mucus, Saliva, Grease, Tears".</p>
      <p>Recite each group for a number of days, and when the respective parts start to appear to the mind along with
        the word, recite the next group. After mastering all well, one should start reciting all thirty-two parts in
        forward and reverse order. All are recited thus:</p>
      <p>“Hair, Body hair, Nails, Teeth, Skin; Flesh, Sinews, Bones, Bone marrow, Kidney; Heart, Liver, Membrane,
        Spleen, Lungs; Intestines, Mesentery, Undigested food, Feces, Brain; Bile, Phlegm, Pus, Blood, Sweat, Fat;
        Tears, Grease, Saliva, Mucus, Synovial fluid, Urine.</p>
      <p>Urine, Synovial fluid, Mucus, Saliva, Grease, Tears; Fat, Sweat, Blood, Pus, Phlegm, Bile; Brain, Feces,
        Undigested food, Mesentery, Intestines; Lungs, Spleen, Membrane, Liver, Heart; Kidney, Bone marrow, Bones,
        Sinews, Flesh; Skin, Teeth, Nails, Body hair, Hair.”</p>
      <p>First Jhana can be obtained from this meditation. By turning it to Vipassana, supramundane paths and fruits can
        also be obtained.</p>
