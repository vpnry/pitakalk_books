      </div>
      <p>Moha (Delusion) is a certain nature that darkens the mind so that it cannot correctly know the object when
        thinking about something. It is generally present in all Akusala Cittas. It is present strongly in the Mohamula
        Citta. The Mohamula Citta is divided by the two Cetasikas: Vicikiccha (Doubt) and Uddhacca (Restlessness).</p>
      <p>The doubt that arises regarding the Triple Gem starting with the Buddha, the results of merits and sins,
        rebirth after death etc. is called Vicikiccha. The restless nature, the agitated nature that arises in the mind
        when thinking or doing something is called Uddhacca. The Mohamula Citta arises sometimes associated with
        Vicikiccha and sometimes associated with strong Uddhacca.</p>
      <p>Because the Mohamula Citta is associated with Moha which covers the nature of the object, because there is no
        certainty about the object, and because it shakes due to Uddhacca, it is not capable of experiencing the taste
        of the object well. Therefore, that Citta is always Upekkha-sahagata (associated with neutral feeling).</p>
      <p>Doubt and restlessness are two things that arise in beings naturally. They are not states that arise due to
        someone's inducement. Therefore, the distinction of Sankhara (prompting) is not found in Mohamula Citta. All
        Mohamula Cittas are Asankharika (unprompted).</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Upekkha-sahagata Vicikiccha-sampayutta Citta</b></li>
        <li><b>Upekkha-sahagata Uddhacca-sampayutta Citta</b></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Thus, there are two Mohamula Cittas.</p>
      <p>Since Mohamula Cittas are weak, they do not produce heavy results like Lobhamula and Dosamula Cittas. The
        special evil in the Vicikiccha-sahagata Citta is that the mind of the person in whom it arises inclines towards
        the five sense pleasures and not towards Kusala (wholesome deeds). Even if a Kusala is done with Vicikiccha, it
        does not become a powerful Kusala.</p>
      <p>Vicikiccha increases in many people by trying to critique matters that are beyond the scope of ordinary people
        and are only within the scope of great beings like the Buddha who possess superior wisdom transcending ordinary
        human knowledge, and by listening to and reading empty criticisms made by ordinary people regarding the next
        world etc. The strategy to eliminate it is to understand the difference between oneself and the Buddha etc. and
        develop Saddha (Faith).</p>
      <p>The Uddhacca-sahagata Citta is something that arises sometimes in urgent matters, when doing many things at
        once, and when working quickly. Since it is very weak, that Citta does not have the strength to cause the being
        to be reborn in Apaya (woeful states) after death. The remaining eleven Akusala Cittas have the strength to
        cause rebirth in Apaya.</p>
      <p>There are twelve Akusala Cittas: eight Lobhamula Cittas, two Dosamula Cittas, and two Mohamula Cittas.</p>
      <p>In those twelve Cittas, there are four Somanassa-sahagata Cittas, six Upekkha-sahagata Cittas, two
        Domanassa-sahagata Cittas, seven Asankharika Cittas, and five Sasankharika Cittas.</p>
