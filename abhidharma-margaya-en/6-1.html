      <p>There are four planes (Bhumis): Apaya Bhumi, Kama Sugati Bhumi, Rupavacara Bhumi, and Arupavacara Bhumi.
        'Bhumi' means the place where beings are born and live.</p>
      <p>There are four Apaya Bhumis: Naraka (Hell), Tirisan Yoni (Animal Realm), Peta Vishaya (Realm of Ghosts), and
        Asura Nikaya (Realm of Asuras).</p>
      <p>There are eight Great Hells (Maha Narakas): Sanjiva, Kalasutra, Sanghata, Raurava, Maha Raurava, Tapana, Maha
        Tapana, and Avici. These Great Hells are situated one below the other inside the earth. They are square. Their
        floor and walls are made of metal. They are also covered by a metal sheet from above. The inside is filled with
        flames. Each hell has four doors in the four directions. The inside of a hell measures one hundred Yojanas in
        each direction.</p>
      <p>On the outside of each Great Hell, in each direction, there are four small hells. They are called '<b>Osupat
          Naraka</b>'. There are sixteen Osupat Narakas for one Great Hell. There are 128 Osupat Narakas for all eight
        Great Hells. Names like Vetarani Naraka, Asipatravana Naraka, Kukkula Naraka, Gutha Naraka, Simbalivana Naraka,
        Lohakumbhi Naraka etc. refer to the Osupat Narakas situated around the Great Hells.</p>
      <p>The multitude of animal beings is very diverse.</p>
      <p>Since there are many beings of various sizes ranging from small beings invisible to the eye to very large
        beings, and of various shapes and various colors, the animal realm is very diverse. There is no separate
        dwelling place for them. The animal species itself is considered as the Tirashcina Bhumi.</p>
      <p>In some places, the name 'Peta' (Ghost) is used for dead people in the sense of "those who have departed from
        this world". In this Apaya discourse, the name 'Peta' is used for a group of suffering beings who are devoid of
        happiness.</p>
      <p>Those Petas, born spontaneously (Opapatika), are born with various sizes, various shapes, and various colors
        according to their Kamma. Therefore, the Peta Nikaya is also very diverse. There is no separate plane for them
        either. The Peta species itself or the place where they live is considered as the Peta Bhumi.</p>
      <p>It is stated that there are four types of Peta species: <b>Paradattupajivika, Khuppipasika, Nijjhamatanhika,
          Kalakanjika</b>.</p>
      <p>Those who live on what is given by others are Paradattupajivikas. They receive food and drink by rejoicing in
        the merits given by others. Those born as Paradattupajivika Petas expect merits from relatives.</p>
      <p>Khuppipasika is a group of Petas who constantly suffer from hunger and thirst due to not receiving food and
        drink.</p>
      <p>Nijjhamatanhika is a group of Petas whose bodies burn constantly inside and outside.</p>
      <p>Kalakanjika is said to be a group of Petas with little blood and flesh, dried up bodies about three Gavvas (a
        measure of distance) in size, with crab-like protruding eyes situated on the top of the head, a very small mouth
        also situated on the top of the head, and who eat food by lowering their head.</p>
      <p>The name <b>Asura</b> is a name used for several groups of beings. The beings belonging to the Asura Nikaya,
        which is one of the four Apayas, are the Kalakanjika Petas. They also do not have a separate dwelling place.</p>
      <p>There is a powerful group of beings living in the Asura Bhavana at the bottom of Mount Meru, using names like
        Vepacitti, Paharada, Sambara, Bali etc. Since they are enemies of the Devas, they are also called by the name
        Asura. They are not beings belonging to Apaya. They belong to a Deva group. There is another group of beings
        called Vinipatika Asura. They are a group of beings belonging to the Caturmaharajika Deva group who obtain food
        and drink with difficulty. Piyankaramata, Uttara Mata etc. belonged to the Vinipatika Asura group. There is also
        a group called Vemanika Peta Asuras. Beings in the Lokantarika Naraka are also called Asuras.</p>
      <p><b>Kama Sugati Bhumis</b></p>
      <p>There are seven Kama Sugati Bhumis: Manushya Bhumi (Human Realm), Caturmaharajika, Tavatimsa, Yama, Tushita,
        Nirmanarati, and Parinirmitavashavarti. These eleven Bhumis, namely the four Apaya Bhumis, the Human World, and
        the six Deva Worlds, are Kamavacara Bhumis.</p>
