      <p>When the Vipassana knowledge of the yogi who is meditating as mentioned develops and comes very close to the
        arising of the Supramundane Path Consciousness called Appana, following the Manodvaravajjana consciousness that
        arose after the cutting off of the Bhavanga consciousness stream, two or three Vipassana consciousnesses arise
        and cease taking one of the three characteristics such as impermanence as the object, under the names
        <b>Parikamma, Upacara, Anuloma</b>. Vutthana (Vyutthana) is also a name used for the Supramundane Path
        Consciousness. The Supramundane Path Consciousness is called <b>Vutthana</b> because it rises from the sign of
        formations which was the object of Vipassana, and from the nature of being the base for fetters. The Path
        Consciousness is also called Vutthana because it raises the person in whom it arises from the state of a
        worldling and from Samsara. Following the Vipassana consciousnesses arising under the names Parikamma, Upacara,
        Anuloma, one consciousness among the Nana-sampayutta Kamavacara Kusala consciousnesses arises under the name
        <b>Gotrabhu</b>, taking Nirvana as the object, destroying the worldling nature of the yogi and entering him into
        the Aryan state. Following that, the <b>Sotapatti Magga Citta</b> associated with the Supramundane Eightfold
        Path arises once performing the function of Javana, fully understanding the Truth of Suffering, abandoning the
        Truth of Origin, and realizing the Truth of Cessation by way of making it the object. Following that, after the
        Sotapatti Phala Citta arises two or three times, it falls into Bhavanga. With the occurrence of this, the yogi
        transcends the state of a worldling and becomes an Aryan person called a Sotapanna.
      </p>
      <p>Then that Sotapanna person reviews the Path he attained, the Fruit he obtained, the defilements abandoned, the
        remaining defilements, and Nirvana. All Aryans review in this manner. Since the Arahant has no remaining
        defilements, he reviews only the other four matters.</p>
      <p>When the Sotapanna person wishes to attain the Sakadagami Path and Fruit, he practices Vipassana on formations
        as before. When Sankharupekkha Nana becomes sharp as mentioned before, Anuloma and Gotrabhu knowledges arise,
        and the Sakadagami Path Consciousness and Fruit Consciousness arise. Anagami and Arahant Path and Fruits also
        arise in the same manner.</p>
      <p>The four Supramundane Paths thus arising are called <b>Nanadassana Visuddhi</b>.</p>
      <p>(Although the <b>classification of Vimokkha</b> is shown here in many books, it is not shown here as it is not
        of much use to ordinary people. Chapter 6 of the book <b>Vipassana Bhavana Krama</b>)</p>
