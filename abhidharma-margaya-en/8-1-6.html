      <p>There are seven Anusaya Dhammas namely <b>Kamaraganusaya - Bhavaraganusaya - Patighanusaya - Mananusaya -
          Ditthanusaya - Vicikicchanusaya - Avijjanusaya</b>.</p>
      <p>Kamaraga etc. which exist dormant in the continuity of beings so that they can rise up when a cause comes are
        called Anusaya. Since they have not arisen as separate Paramartha Dhammas, their existence is not apparent.
        Their existence becomes apparent when a cause arises.</p>
      <p>There are three stages of Kamaraga etc. namely "Anusaya stage - Pariyutthana stage - Vitikkama stage".</p>
      <p>In the continuity of persons who have not eradicated Kamaraga etc. so that they will not arise again in the
        future by generating Lokuttara Magga Nana and by its power, although Kamaraga etc. are not apparent, they exist
        dormant like sleeping, so that they can rise up by meeting beautiful men and women etc. Even great ascetics who
        have completely moved away from Kamas, gone to the forest and generated Jhanas, fall from Jhana due to Kamaraga
        rising up by meeting certain objects, because they exist dormant in the continuity so that their existence is
        not felt. The dormant stage of Kamaraga etc. so that they can rise up when a cause arises is the
        '<b>Anusaya</b>' stage.</p>
      <p>Kamaraga etc. existing in the Anusaya stage surface when a cause like seeing beautiful male - female forms
        arises. They rise up. Rising up means coming to the three moments of arising etc. together with the Javana
        Citta. Thus coming to the three moments of arising etc. together with the Javana Citta is the
        '<b>Pariyutthana</b>' stage of Kamaraga etc.</p>
      <p>Sometimes the risen Kamaraga etc. subside just there. Sometimes they do not subside just there but come to the
        bodily and verbal doors and start acting. Committing wrong following the risen Kamaraga etc. is coming to the
        active state of Kamaraga etc. The acting stage of Kamaraga etc. is the '<b>Vitikkama</b>' stage. Lobha etc.
        which are in the first Anusaya stage out of these three stages of Lobha etc. are called Anusaya. They are not
        absolutely Paramartha Dhammas. Since they are a certain stage of Paramartha Dhammas, they are not
        non-Paramarthas either.</p>
      <p>Kama Tanha existing dormant so that it can arise when a cause arises is called Kamaraganusaya. Such Rupa-Arupa
        Tanha is called Bhavaraganusaya. Dosa is called Patighanusaya. Mana-Ditthi-Vicikiccha Cetasikas are called
        Mananusaya, Ditthanusaya, Vicikicchanusaya. Moha is called Avijjanusaya. Thus, although there are seven
        Anusayas, since both Kamaraganusaya and Bhavaraganusaya are the single Lobha Cetasika, there are six Anusayas by
        way of Cetasika Dhammas.</p>
