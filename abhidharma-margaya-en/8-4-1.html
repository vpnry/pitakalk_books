      <p><b>8th Lesson</b></p>
      <p><b>Rupaskandha, Vedanaskandha, Sannaskandha, Sankharaskandha, Vinnanaskandha</b> are the five Skandhas.</p>
      <p>Rupaskandha is the twenty-eight Rupas mentioned in the Rupa chapter. Taking all Rupas divided as past etc. as
        one group by mind as Rupa nature, it is called Rupaskandha. The meaning of the word Skandha is group. The group
        of Rupa is Rupaskandha.</p>
      <p>Vedanaskandha is the Vedana Cetasika which is one of the fifty-two Cetasikas. Taking all Vedanas divided in
        many ways as past etc. as one by mind as Vedana nature, it is called Vedanaskandha.</p>
      <p>Sannaskandha is the Sanna Cetasika. Taking all Sannas which are of many kinds as past etc. as one by mind as
        Sanna nature, it is called Sannaskandha.</p>
      <p>Sankharaskandha is the remaining fifty Cetasikas excluding Vedana and Sanna. Considering that multitude of
        Cetasikas which are of many kinds as past etc. as one group by mind as Sankhara nature, it is called
        Sankharaskandha.</p>
      <p>Vinnanaskandha is the eighty-nine Cittas. Taking the multitude of Vinnanas which are of many kinds as past etc.
        as one group as Vinnana, it is called Vinnanaskandha.</p>
      <p>Excluding Nibbana from the four Paramarthas, all the rest belong to Pancaskandha. Since Nibbana exists as one
        Dhamma without division as past etc., there is no group of Nibbana. Therefore, it is not included in the Skandha
        Sangaha.</p>
      <p>The word Sankhara is used in several meanings. In the stanza "Anicca vata sankhara", what is meant by Sankhara
        is the thing produced by causes. Since all things belonging to Pancaskandha are Dhammas produced by causes, the
        word "Sankhara" in "Anicca vata sankhara" refers to the Pancaskandha itself. Where it is said Sankharaskandha,
        what is taken by the name Sankhara is the fifty Cetasikas other than Vedana and Sanna. To avoid confusion of
        facts, these two meanings expressed by the word Sankhara should be kept in mind.</p>
      <p>The group of Nama Rupa Dhammas is divided into these five parts as Rupa, Vedana etc. to make it easy to dispel
        the soul perception (Atma Sanna). Soul perception arises separately in the five parts Rupa etc. Soul perception
        arises in Rupa as "I am beautiful, I am tall, short, fat" etc. One takes Vedana as soul as "I feel pleasure, I
        feel pain, it is I who feel pleasure and pain" etc. One takes Sanna as soul by considering "I know such and such
        things, it is I who know". One takes Sankharas as soul as "It is I who give, it is I who take, it is I who go,
        it is I who get attached, it is I who get angry" etc. One takes Vinnana as soul as "I see, I hear" etc. When one
        understands that what ordinary people take as soul are Dhammas such as Rupa, the soul perception is dispelled.
        The benefit of knowing Pancaskandha is the ability to dispel soul perception.</p>
      <p><b>Five Upadanaskandhas</b></p>
      <p><b>Rupupadanaskandha, Vedanupadanaskandha, Sannupadanaskandha, Sankharupadanaskandha, Vinnanupadanaskandha</b>
        are the five Upadanaskandhas. The two Tanha and Ditthi which take Rupa etc. firmly as "mine" and "I" are called
        Upadana. The entire Pancaskandha is not caught by the grasping of Upadanas. What are caught by the grasping of
        Upadanas and become the place for the existence of Upadanas are Lokiya Dhammas. Lokuttara Dhammas are not caught
        by Upadanas. To escape from Samsaric suffering, Upadanas must be destroyed. They can be destroyed by doing
        Vipassana on Rupa Arupa Dhammas which are the places for the growth of Upadanas. Both parts of Dhammas which are
        caught and not caught by Upadanas belong to Pancaskandha. The five Upadanaskandhas have been preached to show
        separately the Dhammas that should be taken for Vipassana.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Rupupadanaskandha is the twenty-eight Rupas. Since Rupa is Lokiya, all of them become places for Upadanas.
        </li>
        <li>Vedanupadanaskandha is the Vedana Cetasika in the eighty-one Lokiya Cittas.</li>
        <li>Sannupadanaskandha is the Sanna Cetasika in the eighty-one Lokiya Cittas.</li>
        <li>Sankharupadanaskandha is the remaining fifty Cetasikas in the Lokiya Cittas.</li>
        <li>Vinnanupadanaskandha is the eighty-one Lokiya Cittas.</li>
      </ol>
