      <p>Mudita meditation is the nature of being happy about happy persons. The yogi who wishes to do it to obtain
        Jhana should take as the object a dear person who has dear and pleasing children, good relatives and friends,
        beautiful houses, vehicles, clothes, ornaments, food and drinks, who is healthy, and lives with bodily and
        mental happiness, and practice Mudita meditation saying "This person lives happily without any deficiency,
        without any bodily or mental suffering. Oh, it is good! Oh, it is good!!". Thus, starting from one person, one
        should gradually increase Mudita. Considering that because of this person, his wife and children live happily,
        one should practice Mudita towards them. Considering that because of this person, his relatives, friends, and
        neighbors live happily, one should practice Mudita towards them. Thus, gradually one should practice Mudita
        towards one's friends, neutral persons, and enemies. After reaching the state where one can practice Mudita
        equally towards everyone, one can obtain Mudita Jhana.</p>
      <p>Those who wish to practice Mudita in the general method should consider the happiness of beings and practice
        Mudita saying "These beings live happily. Oh, it is good! Oh, it is good!". There is no being who cannot be
        considered as happy. In the Brahma world, majestic Brahma kings live very happily for thousands of aeons feeding
        on joy. In Deva worlds such as Chatummaharajika, many Devas live happily in extremely beautiful mansions shining
        with gems, surrounded by nymphs, delighting their senses. In the human world, kings, millionaires, and ordinary
        wealthy people also eat and drink well, dress well, and live happily with their relatives and friends. Poor
        people also somehow obtain the food and drinks they need and become happy. Beings in Apaya will also one day be
        free from that suffering and become happy. Thus, considering the happiness of those respective beings with
        wisdom, one can practice Mudita towards all.</p>
