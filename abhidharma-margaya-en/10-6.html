        <h2>6. Ten Iddhis</h2><i class="material-icons share-icon" file-name="10-6.html">share</i>
      </div>
      <p>There are ten Iddhis: Adhitthaniddhi, Vikubbaniddhi, Manomayiddhi, Nanavipphariddhi, Samadhivipphariddhi,
        Ariyiddhi, Kammavipakajiddhi, Punniddhi, Vijjamayiddhi, Sammappayogapaccayiddhi.</p>
      <p>One becoming a hundred, a thousand, becoming visible, becoming invisible, going through walls and mountains
        without sticking, diving into the ground as if in water etc. is called <b>Adhitthaniddhi</b>.</p>
      <p>Abandoning one's natural form and appearing like a deva, or like a yaksha or rakshasa, or like an animal such
        as a lion or tiger is called <b>Vikubbaniddhi</b>.</p>
      <p>Creating another complete body within one's body by mind and taking it out is called <b>Manomayiddhi</b>. Only
        the mentioned three Iddhis are accomplished by Abhinna power. The occurrence of certain things by the power of a
        certain high knowledge when it arises, or before it arises, or after it arises, is <b>Nanavipphariddhi</b>. If
        the Arahant Path Knowledge is definitely to arise in someone in that life, that person will not die due to any
        reason without obtaining it. In childhood, Venerable Bakkula was swallowed by a fish. But his life was saved.
        That is Nanavipphariddhi. The protection of Venerable <b>Sankicca</b>'s life in childhood, and the protection of
        Venerable <b>Bhutapala</b>'s life is also Nanavipphariddhi.</p>
      <p>The occurrence of certain things by the power of Samadhi during the time of staying in Samadhi, or before or
        after it, is <b>Samadhivipphariddhi</b>. When Venerable Sariputta was staying at Kapotakandara, a yaksha hit him
        a blow hard enough to crush even an elephant. At that occasion, since he was in attainment, he did not feel any
        pain. That is Samadhivipphariddhi. Seeing Venerable <b>Sanjiva</b>, a disciple of Kakusandha Buddha, staying in
        Nirodha Samapatti at the foot of a tree, people thought "This monk has died while sitting", piled wood on him
        and set fire. The fire burned until the wood was finished. Not even his robes were harmed by it. That too is
        Samadhivipphariddhi.</p>
      <p>Since the mind is mastered, Arahants can dwell without loathing towards things others loathe. They can also
        generate loathing towards things others consider high. They can also dwell with equanimity towards all things,
        loathsome and not loathsome. That Iddhi of Arahants is called <b>Ariyiddhi</b>.</p>
      <p>The Iddhi possessed by birds, devas, some humans, and spirits is <b>Kammavipakajiddhi</b>. Those who lived with
        Iddhi were the humans of the first aeon.</p>
      <p>The Iddhi of Universal Monarchs and the Iddhi possessed by some meritorious persons like Jotiya Jatila is
        <b>Punniddhi</b>.
      </p>
      <p>The ability to perform various things by various sciences existing in the world is called <b>Vijjamayiddhi</b>.
      </p>
      <p>Abandoning defilements by right exertion reckoned as practice and accomplishing various other things by means
        is called <b>Sammappayogapaccayiddhi</b>.</p>
