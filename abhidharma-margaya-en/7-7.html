      <p>Among Rupas, there are Rupas produced by only one cause like Kamma etc. There are Rupas produced by two causes.
        There are Rupas produced by three, four causes. There are Rupas produced by no cause at all.</p>
      <p>The nine Rupas namely Hadaya Rupa and eight Indriya Rupas are Rupas produced by Kamma only.</p>
      <p>The two Vinnatti Rupas are produced by Citta only.</p>
      <p>Sabda is produced by both Citta and Utu. The sound of speaking is Cittaja Sabda. The sound produced by blowing
        of wind etc. is Utuja Sabda.</p>
      <p>The three Vikara Rupas namely Lahuta - Muduta - Kammannata are produced by all three causes: Utu - Citta -
        Ahara. Lahutadi Rupas are produced by good Citta - Utu - Ahara. In Cittaja Rupas produced when Utu is bad, in
        Cittaja Rupas produced when Citta is bad, and in Rupa Kalapas produced by unsuitable food, the three Lahutadi
        are not found. When Rupa Kalapas with Lahutadi are absent, the body exists in a heavy, hard state unsuitable for
        action.</p>
      <p>The nine Rupas namely eight Avinibbhoga Rupas and Akasa Dhatu are produced by all four causes. Even in the atom
        considered as the smallest thing, there are many Rupa Kalapas. There is also a space separating those Rupa
        Kalapas from one another. Although it should be said that Akasa Dhatu is something not produced by any cause,
        since the space existing between Rupa Kalapas produced by causes like Kamma etc. separating them is also counted
        as a Rupa produced by respective causes, Akasa Dhatu is spoken of as a Rupa produced by all four causes like
        Kamma etc.</p>
      <p>The four Laksana Rupas are not produced by any cause. They are spoken of as Rupas not produced by causes
        because they are merely the characteristics of arising - decaying - breaking of Rupas produced by causes like
        Kamma etc. The two Rupas Upacaya and Santati are shown in commentaries as Rupas produced by causes like Kamma
        etc.</p>
      <p>The eighteen Rupas namely eight Avinibbhoga Rupas, Akasa Dhatu, Hadaya Rupa, and eight Indriya Rupas are
        Kammaja Rupas.</p>
      <p>The fifteen Rupas namely eight Avinibbhoga Rupas, Akasa Dhatu, Sabda, two Vinnatti Rupas, and three Lahutadi
        Rupas are Cittaja Rupas.</p>
      <p>The thirteen Rupas namely eight Avinibbhoga Rupas, Akasa Dhatu, Sabda, and three Lahutadi are Utuja Rupas.</p>
      <p>The twelve Rupas namely eight Avinibbhoga Rupas, Akasa Dhatu, and three Lahutadi are Aharaja Rupas.</p>
