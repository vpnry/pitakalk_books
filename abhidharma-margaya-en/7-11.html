      <p>The supramundane state of supreme happiness which exists at all times, which has no decay, which has no
        breaking up, which should be seen by oneself with the supramundane path wisdom is called <b>Nibbana</b>.</p>
      <p>Happiness is of two kinds namely Vedayita Sukha and Vimutti Sukha. The happiness experienced through the senses
        like eye etc. is called Vedayita Sukha. All happiness arising in the mind and body by seeing good things and
        good people, hearing good sounds, smelling good scents, tasting good tastes, touching good things to the body,
        obtaining sense objects like vehicles, houses, estates, fields, clothes, ornaments, money etc., obtaining
        positions, respect and honor, and obtaining other desired things are <b>Vedayita Sukhas.</b></p>
      <p>Freedom from suffering and troubles and dangers that have come and that are to come in the future is Vimutti
        Sukha. Nibbana happiness is not a Vedayita Sukha. It is a Vimutti Sukha. People work hard, spend a lot of money,
        even sell their lands and spend when they have no money, even mortgage the house they live in and take money and
        spend to get free from certain sufferings that have come, because the Vimutti Sukha which is the freedom from
        that suffering is a very good thing - a valuable thing. If Vimutti Sukha was a useless thing of no value, people
        would not spend for it. One who is suffering from severe pain cannot get happiness however much wealth he has or
        however many relatives and friends he has. To be able to enjoy Vedayita Sukhas obtained by wealth etc., there
        must be Vimutti Sukha. Therefore, it should be said that Vimutti Sukha is the highest happiness in the world.
      </p>
      <p>For these beings wandering in Samsara, there is the suffering of being born again and again. After birth, there
        is the suffering of decay. There is the suffering of death. There is the suffering of providing food and drink
        etc. There is the suffering of protecting oneself from enemies. There is the suffering of arising of various
        diseases from time to time. There are many sufferings happening from time to time from thieves, enemies etc.
        There are sufferings happening by nature itself. There are sufferings of having to become animals, Petas by
        doing evil deeds. There are sufferings of having to go to hells like Sanjiva, Kalasutra etc. If one does not
        attain Nibbana, the mass of suffering that each person has to undergo in the future is very great. It includes
        immeasurable sufferings of birth, decay, death etc. By attaining Nibbana, one gets free from all that. Nibbana
        is the great Vimutti Sukha which is the freedom from all that.</p>
      <p>If spoken in terms of the mass of suffering that is extinguished for the person attaining Nibbana, it should be
        said that Nibbana is very great. But it is a supreme subtle thing. Therefore, it cannot be seen by people who
        live attached to sense pleasures apart from the right practice. It can be seen by those who are established in
        right practice, engaged in meditation, purified the mind and obtained supramundane wisdom. It is not visible to
        mundane wisdom but to supramundane wisdom. What ordinary people can do is only to guess that there is a good
        thing called Nibbana according to the words of Aryas who have seen Nibbana.</p>
      <p>Nibbana is very close. It is covered by the five aggregates. If the receiving of five aggregates again and
        again stops, Nibbana is obtained. The receiving of five aggregates again and again by way of repeated birth
        happens due to Avijja and Tanha.</p>
      <p>If a person who lived with great difficulty fighting a great battle in a region where rain is not received in
        time, food and drink are scarce, diseases are abundant, flies and mosquitoes are abundant, snakes are abundant,
        thieves and enemies are abundant due to lack of good governance, gets to go and live in a good region with good
        climate, good houses, abundant food and drink, clothes, vehicles, less diseases, no fear of thieves and enemies,
        his delusion that the region he lived in before was good and the attachment he had for that region will
        disappear. Abandonment of defilements means that disappearance. After the abandonment of Avijja and Tanha which
        are the causes for repeated birth, that person will not be born again. Since he does not have the five
        aggregates covering Nibbana after that, he becomes an owner of the bliss of Nibbana.</p>
      <p><b>Divisions of Nibbana</b></p>
      <p>Sankharas which have arising, breaking, existing places, shapes have many divisions because they exist
        separately from one another. In Nibbana which has no arising, no breaking, no existing place, no shape, no sign
        to show or think 'this is Nibbana', such divisions cannot exist. The Nibbana attained by Buddhas, Pacceka
        Buddhas and Arahants who lived in the past, and the Nibbana to be attained by Buddhas, Pacceka Buddhas and
        Buddha's disciples who will appear in the world in the future is one and the same Dhamma by the characteristic
        of peace - the nature of extinguishment. That Nibbana element which has no sign to show or think 'this is it',
        can be shown or thought of according to the aggregates that are extinguished. Since the extinguished aggregates
        are reasons to show that Nibbana as two, it has been preached that Nibbana is twofold as <b>Saupadisesa Nibbana
          Dhatu and Anupadisesa Nibbana Dhatu</b> according to that reason.</p>
      <p><b>Upadi</b> is a name for the aggregates grasped as 'I' and 'mine' by Tanha and Ditthi. The Nibbana of the
        person whose defilements and future aggregates have been extinguished by seeing Nibbana with supramundane path
        wisdom, but who has only the present five aggregates remaining, is called <b>Saupadisesa Nibbana Dhatu</b>
        because the aggregates called Upadi are remaining.</p>
      <p>The Nibbana Dhatu attained after Parinibbana by the person who has abandoned all defilements and remained with
        only the present five aggregates is called <b>Anupadisesa Nibbana Dhatu</b> because the aggregates called Upadi
        are not remaining for him.</p>
      <p>Nibbana is threefold by way of <b>Sunnata - Animitta - Appanihita</b>.</p>
      <p>When there are defilements like Raga etc., there is the obstruction of having to do various evil deeds, the
        obstruction of having to go to Apaya by doing evil deeds, the obstruction of having to protect oneself by
        refraining from evil deeds for the wise. There is the obstruction of having to take much trouble to suppress
        defilements, to abandon defilements. All those obstructions disappear by the cessation of defilements. Nibbana
        which is the cessation of defilements and aggregates is called <b>Sunnata</b> because it removes all those
        obstructions - because it is a place where obstructions are absent. The meaning of Sunnata is the place where
        obstructions due to defilements are absent.</p>
      <p>In Sankharas which have birth, existence by way of continuity, breaking, there is a special mode helpful to
        distinguish one from another as 'this is one', 'this is another', 'this is good', 'this is bad' etc. It is
        called "Nimitta" (Sign). Those Sankharas having signs are objects for defilements like Raga etc. and for various
        kinds of sufferings like decay, death etc. If there is anything called suffering, all that is in Dhammas with
        signs.</p>
      <p>In Nibbana, there is no sign which is a reason to distinguish one from another as 'this is the Nibbana of these
        Supreme Buddhas', 'this is the Nibbana of these Pacceka Buddhas', 'this is the Nibbana of these Buddha's
        disciples', 'this is the Nibbana of these humans', 'this is the Nibbana of these Devas', 'this is the Nibbana of
        these Brahmas', 'this is the Nibbana of Buddhas of such and such Kalpa' etc. It exists as one Dhamma at all
        times. Since there are no signs which are places for defilements, Nibbana Dhatu is called <b>Animitta</b>.</p>
      <p>"Panihita" is a name for desire. Disappearance is the nature of Sankharas. Since whatever Sankharas obtained
        disappear, the desire to obtain again and again arises in the being. Sankharas generate the desire to obtain
        again and again. That desire is the root of all sufferings. Nibbana Dhatu which is the cessation nature of
        Sankharas that cause the suffering of desire, does not generate the desire to obtain again and again because it
        is a Dhamma existing at all times without decay or breaking. That desire is not in Nibbana. Therefore, Nibbana
        Dhatu is called <b>Appanihita</b>.</p>
      <p>Sunnata - Animitta - Appanihita are names given to Nibbana taking those respective qualities as the sign. There
        are many other names for Nibbana. Among those names, the most famous name is Nibbana. Its meaning is the Dhamma
        departed from Tanha (craving). Nibbana does not get caught to Tanha. Also there is no Tanha in Nibbana. This is
        the <b>Analysis of Nibbana</b>.</p>
      <p>Thus far, the four Paramartha Dhammas namely Citta - Cetasika - Rupa - Nibbana have been explained to some
        extent.</p>
      <p>Thus ends the Sixth Chapter which explained Rupa and Nibbana.</p>
