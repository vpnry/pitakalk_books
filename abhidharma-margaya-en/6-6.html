      <p>There are four Kammas according to the order of giving results. These four Kammas are also called "Pakadana
        Paryaya Kamma Catushka".</p>
      <p><b>Garuka Kamma</b></p>
      <p>The powerful Kusala or Akusala Kamma that definitely gives its result in the second birth is called Garuka
        Kamma.</p>
      <p>In the Kusala side, Rupavacara and Arupavacara Kusalas are Garu Kammas. If a person who has attained Rupavacara
        or Arupavacara Jhanas passes away without having any wish for a Kama existence and without falling away from the
        Jhana, that person definitely is born in the Brahma world as a result of the Mahaggata Kusala. There are no
        Kamavacara Kusalas that are Garu Kammas.</p>
      <p>In the Akusala side, the Pancanantarya Kamma and Niyata Mithyadrsti Kamma are Garuka Kammas. If the view is
        given up before death, the Niyata Mithyadrstika becomes free. For those who have done Anantarya Kammas, there is
        no way to escape from Apaya in the second birth.</p>
      <p>The result of a Garu Kamma can only be prevented by a Garu Kamma. Therefore, a person who has several Garu
        Kammas will be born in the second birth as a result of one of those Kammas. Due to that result-giving Kamma, the
        result of the remaining Garu Kammas is prevented.</p>
      <p><b>Asanna Kamma</b></p>
      <p>The Kamma done or remembered at the time of death is called Asanna Kamma. The birth after death of a person who
        does not have a Garuka Kamma happens according to the Asanna Kamma. Even for a person who has done many evil
        deeds, if they can do a Kusala at the time of death, they can be born in Sugati. If they can forget the evil
        deeds done and remember a Kusala, by that they can be born in Sugati. Those who have done many merits also have
        to go to Apaya if they remember evil deeds at the time of death. It is very useful to have a Kalyana Mitra who
        makes one do merits or remember merits at the time of death.</p>
      <p><b>Acinnaka Kamma</b></p>
      <p>Kusala and Akusala Kammas that are done once and remembered repeatedly for a long time, or done repeatedly for
        a long time in life daily or once a week, month, or year are called Acinnaka Kamma. When a certain Kamma is done
        repeatedly, the Kammas done earlier become a support and the Kammas done later become powerful. Kammas done once
        a month, once in several months, or once a year become powerful as Acinnaka Kamma only if they are great Kammas
        that are remembered. Next to Garuka Kamma, the powerful Kamma is Acinnaka Kamma. However, in giving results,
        Asanna Kamma comes forward.</p>
      <p><b>Katattvat Kamma</b></p>
      <p>Kammas done in the present life that do not belong to the three Garuka, Asanna, and Acinnaka Kammas, and Kammas
        done in past lives are called Katattvat Kamma. When there is none of the three Kammas like Garuka etc., birth in
        the next existence happens by Katattvat Kamma. What is mentioned as Garuka etc. in this tetrad are the Janaka
        Kammas mentioned in the Krtya Kamma Catushka.</p>
