      <p>To easily understand the association of Cetasikas, one should recall how Cittas are divided by Jhana and by
        Vedana. It should be remembered that among Ahetuka Akusala Vipakas, there are five Cittas called Vinnana such as
        Cakkhu Vinnana etc. There are also five among Kusala Vipakas. It should be remembered that the name <b>Dvipanca
          Vinnana</b> is used for these ten Cittas.</p>
      <p>Among the fifty-two Cetasikas, it should be known that the seven Sabba Citta Sadharana Cetasikas associate with
        all Cittas without distinction. Among the Pakinnaka Cetasikas, <b>Vitakka</b> associates with fifty-five Cittas:
        the remaining forty-four Kamavacara Cittas excluding the ten Dvipanca Vinnanas, and the eleven First Jhana
        Cittas. It does not associate with the remaining sixty-six Cittas.</p>
      <p><b>Vicara</b> associates with sixty-six Cittas: the fifty-five Cittas where Vitakka associates, and the eleven
        Second Jhana Cittas. It does not associate with the remaining fifty-five Cittas.</p>
      <p><b>Adhimokkha</b> associates with seventy-eight Cittas, excluding the ten Dvipanca Vinnanas and the Vicikiccha
        Sahagata Citta (eleven Cittas). There are eleven Cittas where it does not associate.</p>
      <p><b>Viriya</b> associates with seventy-three Cittas, excluding the sixteen Cittas: Pancadvaravajjana, Dvipanca
        Vinnanas, two Sampaticchanas, and three Santiranas. It does not associate with sixteen Cittas. </p>
      <p><b>Piti</b> associates with fifty-one Cittas, excluding the seventy Cittas: two Domanassa Sahagata Cittas,
        fifty-five Upekkha Sahagata Cittas, two Kaya Vinnanas, and eleven Fourth Jhana Cittas. There are seventy Cittas
        where it does not associate.</p>
      <p><b>Chanda</b> associates with sixty-nine Cittas, excluding the twenty Cittas: eighteen Ahetuka Cittas and two
        Moha Mula Cittas. There are twenty Cittas where it does not associate.</p>
      <p><b>Special Facts:</b></p>
      <p>For the Dvipanca Vinnanas arising due to the contact of objects like Rupa with bases like Eye, the help of
        Vitakka is not needed to go to the object. Therefore, Vitakka does not associate with those Cittas. Vitakka is
        also not needed for Second Jhana Cittas etc. as they are developed by meditation to be able to go to the object
        without Vitakka.</p>
      <p>Since Dvipanca Vinnanas are a weak group of Cittas, not a single Pakinnaka Cetasika associates with them.
        Vitakka does not associate with Second Jhana Cittas etc. because it has been abandoned by the power of
        meditation.</p>
      <p>Since Adhimokkha is a Cetasika with the nature of deciding, it does not associate with the Vicikiccha Sahagata
        Citta. Viriya Cetasika does not associate with Cittas like Pancadvaravajjana because those Cittas are weak.</p>
      <p>Since Domanassa and Upekkha feelings are opposed to Piti, Piti does not associate with Domanassa and Upekkha
        Sahagata Cittas. Although Kaya Vinnana is Sukha Sahagata, Piti does not associate with it because it is weak.
        Piti does not arise in the Somanassa Sahagata Fourth Jhana Citta because it is abandoned by the power of
        meditation. Chanda does not associate with Ahetuka Cittas and Moha Mula Cittas because they are a weak group of
        Cittas without the desire to do anything.</p>
      <p>In finding the numbers of Cetasikas associating with Cittas, these six Pakinnaka Cetasikas are always
        confusing. Therefore, the association of those Cetasikas should be mastered well. The only Cittas where not a
        single Pakinnaka Cetasika associates are the ten Panca Vinnana Cittas. All Pakinnaka Cetasikas associate with
        these twenty-seven Cittas: four Lobha Mula Somanassa Sahagata Cittas, twelve Kamavacara Sobhana Somanassa
        Sahagata Cittas, and eleven First Jhana Cittas. In the remaining Cittas, they associate as appropriate. Since
        Sabba Citta Sadharana Cetasikas associate with all Cittas, there is nothing special to look for about them. Find
        the Pakinnaka Cetasikas associating with all one hundred and twenty-one Cittas starting from Somanassa Sahagata
        Ditthi Sampayutta Asankharika Citta. Master it until you can say it quickly.</p>
