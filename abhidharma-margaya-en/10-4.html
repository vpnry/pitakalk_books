      <p><b>Lesson 7</b></p>
      <p>The yogi who has obtained the First Jhana, in order to be able to obtain the Second Jhana, should develop the
        fivefold mastery in the First Jhana: Avarjana Vasita, Samapajjana Vasita, Adhitthana Vasita, Vutthana Vasita,
        and Paccavekkhana Vasita. The ability to reflect on the factors of the First Jhana one by one very quickly
        without delay is <b>Avarjana Vasita</b>. The ability to enter Jhana quickly without delay when one wishes to
        enter is called <b>Samapajjana Vasita</b>. The ability to maintain the entered Jhana even for a short time like
        a second or two is called <b>Adhitthana Vasita</b>. The ability to emerge from Jhana exactly at the determined
        time without letting the time pass is called <b>Vutthana Vasita</b>. It is the normal nature for Kamavacara
        Javana to arise seven times in each cognitive process. The ability to review Jhana factors very quickly so that
        seven Javanas do not arise in reviewing cognitive processes when reflecting on Vitakka etc. is called
        <b>Paccavekkhana Vasita</b>.
      </p>
      <p>To the yogi who has thus developed mastery in the First Jhana, Vitakka, which is a factor of the First Jhana,
        appears as a gross thing, and obtaining Jhana without it appears as good. Desiring to obtain a Jhana free from
        Vitakka, he starts attending to the Pathavi Kasina counterpart sign again as 'Pathavi, Pathavi'. Since that
        meditation of his is done to eliminate the gross Jhana factor called Vitakka, it is called <b>Vitakka Viraga
          Bhavana</b>. By the power of that Vitakka Viraga Bhavana, at some occasion, the Second Jhana consciousness
        accompanied by the four factors: Vicara, Piti, Sukha, Ekaggata arises in him in that Pathavi Kasina sign.</p>
      <p>To the yogi who has developed mastery in the Second Jhana, Vicara starts to appear as a gross factor. To the
        yogi who has obtained the Third Jhana and developed mastery, Piti appears as a gross factor, and to the yogi who
        has obtained the Fourth Jhana, Sukha appears as a gross factor. By doing Parikamma on the Pathavi Kasina sign
        with the intention of overcoming the gross factor, gradually the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Jhanas also arise.
        Generating Jhanas from the remaining nine Kasinas such as Apo Kasina is also done in the described manner.</p>
      <p><b>Arupa Jhanas</b></p>
      <p>The yogi who has obtained Jhana from one Kasina can generate the sign by just thinking of those Kasinas without
        making Kasina disks and meditating, and can transfer his Jhana to any Kasina he likes. Similarly, Kasina signs
        can also be enlarged by mind as much as needed. Arupa Jhanas are generated by doing Parikamma on the Space sign
        extracted from Kasina signs. Space can be extracted from the nine Kasinas other than the Akasa Kasina. Another
        space cannot be obtained from the Akasa Kasina sign.</p>
      <p>The yogi who wishes to generate Arupa Jhanas should first develop the fivefold mastery in the Rupavacara Fifth
        Jhana. Then, having entered the Fifth Jhana of a Kasina other than the Akasa Kasina, having emerged from it, he
        should spread the Kasina sign that was the object of the Jhana consciousness. Spreading means enlarging the
        Kasina sign. As the yogi thinks, the Kasina sign will appear enlarged to him. Then, if that enlarged Kasina sign
        is the Pathavi Kasina sign, without thinking of it as earth, he should think <b>'Akasa - Akasa' (Space -
          Space)</b> or <b>'Anantakasa - Anantakasa' (Infinite Space - Infinite Space)</b>. When meditating thus, the
        Rupa Kasina sign disappears and space starts to appear in the place where that Kasina sign appeared. Since it is
        obtained from the Kasina, that appearing space is called <b>'Kasinugghatimakasa'</b>. Its meaning is space
        extracted from the Kasina. To the yogi who engages in meditation saying 'Infinite Space' establishing the mind
        in the Kasinugghatimakasa, at some occasion, the Akasanancayatana Jhana consciousness, which is the First Arupa
        Jhana consciousness, arises in that object.</p>
      <p>The yogi who has mastered the Akasanancayatana Jhana, in order to move further away from Rupa, abandoning the
        Space object, taking the Akasanancayatana consciousness that existed taking Space as the object, starts
        meditating taking it as the object saying "<b>Vinnanam Anantam, Vinnanam Anantam</b>" (Consciousness is
        Infinite, Consciousness is Infinite). To the yogi who does so, at some occasion, the Vinnanancayatana
        consciousness, which is the Second Arupa Jhana consciousness, arises taking the First Arupa consciousness as the
        object.</p>
      <p>To the yogi who has generated the Vinnanancayatana Jhana, by meditating <b>"Natthi Kinci - Natthi Kinci"</b>
        (There is nothing - There is nothing) taking the non-existence of the First Arupavacara consciousness as the
        object, the Akincannayatana Jhana consciousness arises.</p>
      <p>To the yogi who has generated the Akincannayatana Jhana, by meditating "<b>Santametam Panitametam</b>" (This is
        peaceful, this is sublime) taking the Akincannayatana consciousness which is the Third Arupa Jhana consciousness
        as the object, the Nevasannanasannayatana Jhana consciousness arises.</p>
