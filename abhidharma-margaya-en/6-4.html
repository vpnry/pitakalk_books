      <p>Because of the Catushka method and Pancaka method of Rupavacara Jhanas, there are two methods. In the Citta
        Pariccheda, Jhana Cittas are shown in the Pancaka method. The Pancaka method is the method where there are five
        Jhanas. The Catushka method is the method where there are four Jhanas. In the Sutta Pitaka, the Catushka method
        of Jhanas is found. In the Abhidhamma Pitaka, both methods are shown. Since the Catushka method is included in
        the Pancaka method, the analysis of consciousness (Citta Vibhaga) is done according to the Pancaka method.
        Rupavacara Bhumis exist according to the Catushka method. The second and third Jhanas of the Pancaka method
        become the second Jhana of the Catushka method.</p>
      <p>Of the Rupavacara Vipaka Cittas, the First Jhana Vipaka exists as Patisandhi, Bhavanga, and Cuti in the First
        Jhana Bhumi.</p>
      <p>The Second Jhana Vipaka Citta and the Third Jhana Vipaka Citta exist as Patisandhi, Bhavanga, and Cuti in the
        Second Jhana Bhumi.</p>
      <p>The Fourth Jhana Vipaka exists as Patisandhi, Bhavanga, and Cuti in the Third Jhana Bhumi.</p>
      <p>In the Asanna Bhumi, what arises as Patisandhi is only Rupa (Matter). During the course of existence (Pavatti),
        only Rupa exists there. At the time of passing away from that existence, that lineage of Rupa ceases.</p>
      <p>These are the six Rupavacara Patisandhis.</p>
      <p><b>Lifespan in Rupavacara Bhumis</b></p>
      <p>Since the lifespan in Rupa and Arupa worlds is very long, it cannot be expressed in years. Their lifespan is
        stated in Kalpas. A Kalpa is a very long period of time. The lifespan in Rupa and Arupa worlds becomes that long
        because one is born there through a very powerful Kusala.</p>
      <p>Of the First Jhana Bhumis, the lifespan in Brahmaparisajjaya is one-third of an Asankhya Kalpa. The lifespan in
        Brahmapurohita is half of an Asankhya Kalpa. The lifespan in Mahabrahma is one Asankhya Kalpa. Since these three
        Brahma worlds are destroyed in every Kalpa, one gets to live for a full Asankhya Kalpa in Mahabrahma only if one
        is born there at the beginning of the Kalpa. Those who are born in these Bhumis when the destruction of the
        Kalpa is approaching do not get to enjoy the full lifespan.</p>
      <p>Of the Second Jhana Bhumis, the lifespan in Parittabha is two Maha Kalpas. The lifespan in Appamanabha is four
        Maha Kalpas. The lifespan in Abhassara is eight Maha Kalpas. The lifespan in higher Brahma worlds should also be
        understood in Maha Kalpas.</p>
      <p>Of the Third Jhana Bhumis, the lifespan in Parittasubha is sixteen Kalpas. In Appamanasubha it is thirty-two
        Kalpas. In Subhakinhaka it is sixty-four Kalpas.</p>
      <p>Of the Fourth Jhana Bhumis, the lifespan in the two Bhumis Vehapphala and Asanna Satta is five hundred Kalpas
        each. In Aviha it is one thousand Kalpas. In Atappa it is two thousand Kalpas. In Sudassa it is four thousand
        Kalpas. In Sudassi it is eight thousand Kalpas. In Akanittha it is sixteen thousand Kalpas.</p>
      <p>The four Arupa Vipaka Cittas such as Akasanancayatana etc. exist as Patisandhi, Bhavanga, and Cuti in the four
        Bhumis Akasanancayatana etc. respectively. There are four Arupa Patisandhis.</p>
      <p><b>Lifespan in Arupa Bhumis</b></p>
      <p>In Akasanancayatana, it is twenty thousand Kalpas. In Vinnanancayatana, it is forty thousand Kalpas. In
        Akincannayatana, it is sixty thousand Kalpas. In Nevasannanasannayatana, it is eighty-four thousand Kalpas. </p>
      <p>There are three types of Kalpas: "Antah Kalpa, Asankhya Kalpa, and Maha Kalpa". There comes a time when the
        lifespan of humans gradually decreases and ten years becomes the maximum lifespan. At that time, a great
        destruction of humans occurs due to diseases, war, or famine. Only a very few remain. After that, as humans
        start to practice good conduct, their lifespan starts to increase little by little from generation to
        generation. That increase grows up to an Asankhya of years. After that, by turning to misconduct, humans start
        to decline again. Gradually declining, it reaches the time when ten years is the maximum lifespan. At that time,
        again a destruction of humans occurs.</p>
      <p>The time taken for the human lifespan to increase from ten years up to an Asankhya and decrease again until ten
        years becomes the maximum lifespan is called an Antah Kalpa.</p>
      <p>There are four Asankhya Kalpas called <b>"Samvarta, Samvartasthayi, Vivarta, Vivartasthayi"</b>.</p>
      <p>Once in a long time, this great earth along with Deva worlds and certain Brahma worlds is destroyed by fire,
        water, or wind. It takes a very long time for the world to be destroyed once. The time during which the world is
        being destroyed is called the Samvarta Kalpa. After the world is destroyed, it remains empty for a time equal to
        the time taken for destruction. That time is called the Samvartasthayi Kalpa. Again the world starts to form
        little by little. The time taken for the world to form and become complete is called the Vivarta Kalpa. The time
        existing from when the world is complete until it starts to be destroyed again is called the Vivartasthayi.
        These four Asankhya Kalpas make one Maha Kalpa. The measure of an Asankhya Kalpa is twenty Antah Kalpas. The
        measure of a Maha Kalpa is eighty Antah Kalpas.</p>
      <p>The world is destroyed by fire seven times in succession. In the eighth time, it is destroyed by water. The
        world thus destroyed is destroyed by wind in the sixty-fourth time. When the world is destroyed by fire,
        everything below Abhassara is destroyed. When destroyed by water, everything below Subhakinhaka is destroyed,
        and when destroyed by wind, everything below Vehapphala is destroyed. </p>
