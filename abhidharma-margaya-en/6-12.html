      </div>
      <p>Maranasanna Vithis are sixfold as Cakkhudvara Vithi - Sotadvara Vithi - Ghanadvara Vithi - Jihvadvara Vithi -
        Kayadvara Vithi - Manodvara Vithi. Of them, Cakkhudvara Maranasanna Vithi is fourfold as: Vithi where Cuti
        occurs after Javana, Vithi where Cuti occurs after Javana-Bhavanga, Vithi where Cuti occurs after Tadarammana,
        and Vithi where Cuti occurs after Tadarammana-Bhavanga. Of the things that appear at the moment of death, Kamma
        appears only to the Mind Door. Sometimes, a thing present before the eye at the moment of death can itself be
        the Kamma Nimitta. Cakkhudvara Maranasanna Vithi arises in such an occasion. Rarely, Gati Nimitta can also be
        seen by the eye. In such occasions, Cakkhudvara Maranasanna Vithis taking Gati Nimitta as object can also arise.
      </p>
      <p>The Cakkhudvara Maranasanna Vithi where Cuti occurs after Javana is as follows:-</p>
      <p>If a Ruparammana which is a Kamma Nimitta comes to the Eye Door at the moment of death, after the arising and
        ceasing of Atita Bhavanga - Bhavanga Calana - Bhavangupaccheda - Pancadvaravajjana - Cakkhu Vinnana -
        Sampaticchana - Santirana - Votthapana Cittas in order, and after the arising and ceasing of some Kamavacara
        Javana five times in order, the Cuti Citta which is the last Citta of the present life arises and ceases.
        Immediately after that, some Kamavacara Patisandhi Citta arises and ceases. Immediately after that, in the new
        life, after that very Patisandhi Citta arises and ceases fifteen or sixteen times performing the function of
        Bhavanga, Manodvaravajjana Citta taking the present life as object arises, and after that a Lobha Mula Javana
        arises seven times as attachment to the present life. After that, Bhavanga Patana occurs.</p>
      <p>In this Maranasanna Vithi, the object for the Cittas from Pancadvaravajjana up to the fifth Javana is the Atita
        Bhavanga and the arisen present Rupa. From Atita Bhavanga up to the fifth Javana, there are thirteen Cittas.
        That Rupa has a life of another four Citta moments after the fifth Javana. Therefore, the object for the
        Patisandhi Citta and the two Bhavangas arising after it is the present Rupa that was the object for
        Pancadvaravajjana etc. Cittas. That Ruparammana ceases after spending its life of seventeen Citta moments along
        with the second Bhavanga Citta arising after Patisandhi. Therefore, the object for the Bhavanga Cittas arising
        after that is the past Ruparammana which was the Kamma Nimitta.</p>
      <p>In this Vithi, the object for Atita Bhavanga - Bhavanga Calana - Bhavangupaccheda and Cuti is one of Kamma etc.
        that was the object for the Maranasanna Javanas of the immediately preceding past life. Since Kammaja Rupas do
        not arise in the dying person's body after the arising moment of the seventeenth Citta from the Cuti Citta, the
        support (Nissaya) for Pancadvaravajjana etc. Cittas in this Vithi is the seventeenth Citta from the Cuti Citta
        and the arisen Hadaya Vatthu. The support for Cakkhu Vinnana is also the seventeenth Citta from the Cuti Citta
        and the arisen Cakkhu Vatthu. When Patisandhi arises, the Vatthu Rupa supporting that Citta also arises
        simultaneously with it. The support for the Patisandhi Citta is the Vatthu Rupa arising simultaneously with that
        Citta. The support for the Bhavanga etc. Cittas arising after that is the Citta born before each respective
        Citta and the arisen Hadaya Vatthu Rupa. The order of Cittas in all four Cakkhudvara Maranasanna Vithis should
        be understood by looking at the chart below.</p>
      <p><b>Cakkhudvara Maranasanna Vithis</b></p>
      <div class="gatha">
        <p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 </p>
        <p>Ti Na Da Pa Ca Sam Na Vo Ja Ja Ja Ja Ja Cu Pra Bha Bha</p>
        <p>Ti Na Da Pa Ca Sam Na Vo Ja Ja Ja Ja Ja Bha Cu Pra Bha</p>
        <p>Ti Na Da Pa Ca Sam Na Vo Ja Ja Ja Ja Ja Ta Ta Cu Pra</p>
        <p>Ti Na Da Pa Ca Sam Na Vo Ja Ja Ja Ja Ja Ta Ta Bha Cu</p>
      </div>
      <p>Sota - Ghana - Jivha - Kayadvara Maranasanna Vithis should also be understood according to Cakkhudvara Vithis.
        The only difference is the application of Srotra Vinnana etc. in places where Cakkhu Vinnana is applied.
        Sotadvara Maranasanna Vithis can arise for those who die while listening to Dhamma. Ghanadvara Maranasanna
        Vithis can arise for those who die while smelling the scent of offerings etc. Jihvadvara Maranasanna Vithis can
        arise for those into whose mouth something is poured at the moment of death, and Kayadvara Maranasanna Vithis
        can arise for those who die while receiving the touch of someone. The four Manodvara Maranasanna Vithis should
        be understood from the chart shown below.</p>
      <div class="gatha">
        <p>Na Da Ma Ja Ja Ja Ja Ja Cu</p>
        <p>Na Da Ma Ja Ja Ja Ja Ja Bha Cu</p>
        <p>Na Da Ma Ja Ja Ja Ja Ja Ta Ta Cu</p>
        <p>Na Da Ma Ja Ja Ja Ja Ja Ta Ta Bha Cu</p>
      </div>
      <p>Any of the three: Kamma, Kamma Nimitta, Gati Nimitta becomes the object for Kamavacara Patisandhi. Only Kamma
        Nimitta becomes the object for Rupavacara and Arupavacara Patisandhis. For them, the Kasina Nimitta etc. which
        are the objects of the Jhanas they have attained become the object as Kamma Nimitta. </p>
      <p>For beings born in Asanna Bhava, there is no arising of Patisandhi Citta after Cuti. For them, after Cuti,
        Jivita Navaka Rupa Kalapas arise as Patisandhi in Asanna Bhava. Therefore, they are Rupa Patisandhikas. Beings
        born in Arupa Bhumi are Arupa Patisandhikas. Since Rupas also arise when other Patisandhis arise, except Asanna
        beings and Arupa beings, others are Ruparupa Patisandhikas. </p>
      <p>From the four Arupavacara Cutis, except the lower Arupavacara Patisandhis, the remaining Arupavacara
        Patisandhis and Kama Tihetuka Patisandhis can arise. For one falling from a higher Arupa Bhumi, a lower Arupa
        Patisandhi does not arise. For those falling from all Arupa Bhumis, Rupavacara Patisandhi or Kamavacara Ahetuka
        Dvihetuka Patisandhis do not arise. From Rupavacara Cutis, except Ahetuka Patisandhis, remaining Patisandhis can
        arise. From the Cuti of a Tihetuka person in Kama Loka, all Patisandhis can arise. From Dvihetuka Ahetuka Cutis,
        only Kamavacara Patisandhis can arise.</p>
      <p>For the person falling after living in Asanna Bhumi for five hundred Kalpas, there is no Cuti Citta. The Jivita
        Navaka Rupa Kalapas arising for the last time are his Cuti. He has no appearance of Kamma - Kamma Nimitta - Gati
        Nimitta. Taking as object one of the Kamma etc. presented by the Upacara Cetanas of the Fifth Jhana he had
        attained before coming to Asanna Bhava, Kamavacara Patisandhi arises for him after Asanna Sattva Cuti.</p>
      <p>Thus, for beings conceived in existence, after the cessation of the <b>Patisandhi Citta</b>, that very Citta
        taking that very object arises repeatedly throughout that whole life whenever there is no other Citta. Since the
        being lives, his Citta lineage is not cut off, because that Citta arises repeatedly. Since it arises as a
        support for the existence of Bhava, that Citta is called <b>Bhavanga</b>. The last Citta of the Bhava is also
        that very Citta. When it arises as the last Citta, it is called <b>Cuti Citta</b>. </p>
      <p>Thus, just as Patisandhi Bhavanga Cittas and Vithi Cittas and Cuti arise in this present life, in future lives
        too, by the arising of Patisandhi etc., this Citta lineage continues rolling as one lineage until it reaches
        Nibbana.</p>
      <p>Wise ones, seeing the danger of having to die and be born repeatedly due to the unbroken continuity of the
        Citta lineage in this way, attain Magga Phala through right practice, cut off the bond of Tanha and go to
        Nirvana where there is no death and birth.</p>
