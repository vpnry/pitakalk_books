      <p><b>Lesson 20</b></p>
      <p>There are seven Abhinnas (Direct Knowledges): Dibbacakkhu (Divine Eye), Dibbasota (Divine Ear), Iddhividha
        (Psychic Powers), Paracittavijanana (Penetration of others' minds), Pubbenivasanussati (Recollection of past
        lives), Yathakammupaga (Knowledge of beings passing away and arising according to their kamma), and Anagatamsa
        (Knowledge of the future). In places where five Abhinnas are mentioned, it is by including Yathakammupaga and
        Anagatamsa Abhinnas within the Dibbacakkhu Abhinna. Before an Abhinna Vithi, there is a Padaka (Base) Fifth
        Jhana Samapatti Vithi, an Adhitthana (Determination) Vithi, and again a Padaka Jhana Samapatti Vithi. To develop
        Abhinna power, one must first enter Jhana. Since it is the foundation for Abhinna, it is called <b>Padaka
          Jhana</b>.</p>
      <p>The attainer of eight attainments who wishes to see something far away with <b>Dibbacakkhu Abhinna</b> enters
        the Fifth Jhana on one of the Kasinas among Tejo Kasina - Odata Kasina - Aloka Kasina. After rising from it, he
        determines "May such and such thing be visible". As a result of the determination, a Kamajavana Vithi arises.
        Having determined, he enters the Padaka Fifth Jhana again. After rising from it, the Abhinna Vithi seeing the
        determined form arises. It is as follows:- For the yogi who has risen from the Padaka Jhana, after Bhavanga
        Calana - Bhavangupaccheda, the Manodvaravajjana consciousness arises taking the determined form as the object,
        and after a Kamavacara Javana arises four times under the names Parikamma - Upacara - Anuloma - Gotrabhu, the
        Abhinna consciousness seeing the distant form as if seeing with the eye arises once and ceases. After that, it
        becomes Bhavanga. This is the Dibbacakkhu Abhinna Vithi.</p>
      <p><b>Dibbacakkhu Abhinna Vithi of the Mandapanna.</b></p>
      <p>Na - Da - Ma - Pa - U - A - Go - Abhinna - Bha</p>
      <p><b>Vithi of the Tikkhapanna</b></p>
      <p>Na - Da - Ma - U - A - Go - Abhinna - Bha.</p>
      <p>It is said that Aloka Kasina is better for making it the base for Abhinnas such as Dibbacakkhu. The Fifth Jhana
        taking Pathavi Kasina as the object is made the base for Iddhividha Abhinna.</p>
      <p><b>Nirodha Samapatti Vithi</b></p>
      <p>When an Anagami or Arahant person who has developed mastery in the eight attainments wishes to enter Nirodha
        Samapatti, he enters the Jhanas from the First Jhana up to Akincannayatana Jhana in order and contemplates their
        formations as impermanent etc. Then, when the preliminary duties for Nirodha Samapatti are completed, after
        Bhavanga Calana and Bhavangupaccheda, the Manodvaravajjana consciousness arises, and after a Kamavacara Javana
        arises four times or three times under the names Parikamma, Upacara, Anuloma, Gotrabhu, the
        Nevasannanasannayatana Jhana consciousness arises twice, and the consciousness stream is cut off.</p>
      <p>Throughout the time expected by the yogi, consciousness and mind-born matter are absent, and only the remaining
        matter exists. As soon as the expected time elapses, without an adverting, if the person who attained is an
        Anagami, the Anagami Phala consciousness arises once; if an Arahant person, the Arahatta Phala consciousness
        arises once. After that, it becomes Bhavanga. This is the Nirodha Samapatti Vithi.</p>
