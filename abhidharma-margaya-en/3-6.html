      <p><b>Samma Vaca, Samma Kammanta, Samma Ajiva</b> - these three Cetasikas are called Virati.</p>
      <p>The nature of abstaining from the four verbal sins: lying, slandering, harsh speech, and frivolous talk, is
        called "Samma Vaca".</p>
      <p>The nature of abstaining from the three bodily sins: killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct, is called "Samma
        Kammanta".</p>
      <p>Sins done by body and speech are done as a means of livelihood, and also for other reasons. The nature of
        abstaining from bodily and verbal misconduct done for livelihood is called "Samma Ajiva".</p>
      <p>Since sins are abstained from by means of these three Cetasikas, they are called <b>Virati</b>.</p>
      <p><b>Karuna and Mudita</b> - these two Cetasikas are called <b>Appamanna</b>.</p>
      <p>Just as one does not like suffering happening to oneself, the nature of not liking others suffering, the nature
        of wishing to release others from suffering is called "Karuna".</p>
      <p>Just as one is happy if one receives some prosperity, the nature of being happy about others' prosperity is
        called "Mudita".</p>
      <p>Since these two proceed towards immeasurable beings, they are called Appamanna.</p>
      <p>The nature of seeing objects better, more purely, more deeply than knowing by mind is <b>Panna Cetasika</b>. It
        is also called "Amoha" and "Vijja".</p>
      <p>The nineteen Sobhana Sadharana Cetasikas, the three Viratis, the two Appamannas, and the Panna Cetasika - these
        twenty-five Cetasikas are called "Sobhana Cetasikas".</p>
      <p><b>Special Facts</b></p>
      <p>Each of the Virati Cetasikas is threefold as Sampatta Virati, Samadana Virati, and Samuccheda Virati. When an
        occasion to commit a sin arises, without having undertaken precepts beforehand, or even if precepts were
        undertaken without regard for them, considering only the fault of the sin, the abstinence that arises in one
        abstaining from sin is called "Sampatta Virati". The abstinence arising by way of undertaking precepts and by
        way of protecting the undertaken precepts is called "Samadana Virati". The Viratis arising with the Lokuttara
        Magga Citta are called "Samuccheda Virati".</p>
      <p>There are four Appamannas: Maitri, Karuna, Mudita, Upekkha. In these Sobhana Cetasikas, only two Cetasikas are
        shown under the name Appamanna because Upekkha was included in Sobhana Sadharana Cetasikas under the name
        Tatramajjhattata, and Maitri under the name Adosa.</p>
      <p><b>Memorize these.</b></p>
      <p>"Phassa, Vedana, Sanna, Cetana, Ekaggata, Jivitindriya, Manasikara" are the seven Sabba Citta Sadharana
        Cetasikas.</p>
      <p>"Vitakka, Vicara, Adhimokkha, Viriya, Piti, Chanda" are the six Pakinnaka Cetasikas.</p>
      <p>"Moha, Ahirika, Anottappa, Uddhacca, Lobha, Ditthi, Mana, Dosa, Issa, Macchariya, Kukkucca, Thina, Middha,
        Vicikiccha" are the fourteen Akusala Cetasikas.</p>
      <p>"Saddha, Sati, Hiri, Ottappa, Alobha, Adosa, Tatramajjhattata, Kayapassaddhi, Cittapassaddhi, Kayalahuta,
        Cittalahuta, Kayamuduta, Cittamuduta, Kayakammannata, Cittakammannata, Kayapagunnata, Cittapagunnata,
        Kayujjukata, Cittujjukata" are the nineteen Sobhana Sadharana Cetasikas.</p>
      <p>"Samma Vaca, Samma Kammanta, Samma Ajiva" are the three Viratis.</p>
      <p>"Karuna, Mudita" are the two Appamannas. Together with "Panna" Cetasika, these twenty-five Cetasikas are
        Sobhana Cetasikas.</p>
      <p>Thirteen Annasamana, fourteen Akusala, twenty-five Sobhana; there are fifty-two Cetasikas.</p>
