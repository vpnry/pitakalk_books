      <p>There are ten Vipassana knowledges: Sammasana Nana, Udayabbaya Nana, Bhanganupassana Nana, Bhayatupatthana
        Nana, Adinavanupassana Nana, Nibbidanupassana Nana, Muncitukamyata Nana, Patisankhanupassana Nana,
        Sankharupekkha Nana, and Anuloma Nana.</p>
      <p><b>Sammasana Nana</b></p>
      <p>The knowledge that knows the three characteristics such as impermanence of Nama and Rupa dhammas is called
        Sammasana Nana. It has already been attained by the yogi who has developed Maggamagga Nanadassana Visuddhi. What
        he has to do next is to meditate to develop the nine knowledges starting from Udayabbaya Nana. The nine
        Vipassana knowledges starting from Udayabbaya Nana up to Anuloma Nana that arise in the future for the person
        who has developed Maggamagga Nanadassana Visuddhi while doing Vipassana is <b>Patipada Nanadassana Visuddhi</b>.
      </p>
      <p><b>Udayabbaya Nana</b></p>
      <p>The Vipassana knowledge that sees how new formations arise that did not exist before and how all arisen
        formations break up is called 'Udayabbaya Nana'.</p>
      <p><b>Bhanganupassana Nana</b></p>
      <p>As the knowledge of the yogi who practices Vipassana by looking at the arising and breaking up of formations
        that are caught by his mind develops and sharpens, very quickly many formations appear to his mind, and he does
        not have time to recall the arising and breaking up of all of them. Then the yogi gives up attending to the
        arising of the formations that appear and starts looking only at their dissolution. Just as bubbles of water are
        seen breaking up when looking at a reservoir when it is raining, the breaking up of formations in his own
        continuity begins to appear to his wisdom. That knowledge which sees the breaking up of formations is called
        'Bhanganupassana Nana'.</p>
      <p><b>Bhayatupatthana Nana</b></p>
      <p>To the yogi who sees formations breaking up everywhere in the three existences of Kama, Rupa, and Arupa like
        mustard seeds popping in a pan, the group of breaking up formations begins to appear as something to be feared.
        That Vipassana knowledge which sees formations as fearful is called 'Bhayatupatthana Nana'.</p>
      <p><b>Adinavanupassana Nana</b></p>
      <p>The breaking up of formations cannot be stopped by anyone by any means. There is no refuge for them. They are
        helpless. The Vipassana knowledge that sees that helplessness of formations is 'Adinavanupassana Nana'.</p>
      <p><b>Nibbidanupassana Nana</b></p>
      <p>By seeing the helplessness of the group of formations which the yogi had clung to as 'I' and 'mine' in the
        past, disenchantment arises in the yogi regarding them. The yogi becomes weary of the multitude of formations.
        The Vipassana knowledge that has the nature of being disenchanted with formations is called 'Nibbidanupassana
        Nana'.</p>
      <p><b>Muncitukamyata Nana</b></p>
      <p>The Vipassana knowledge accompanied by the desire to be released from those disenchanted formations is called
        'Muncitukamyata Nana'.</p>
      <p><b>Patisankhanupassana Nana</b></p>
      <p>The extensive Vipassana knowledge of the yogi who wishes to be released from formations, contemplating
        formations in detail in various ways as a means to be released from them, is called "Patisankhanupassana Nana".
      </p>
      <p><b>Sankharupekkha Nana</b></p>
      <p>Having seen the great mass of faults of formations with Patisankhanupassana Nana, and now happy that 'I have
        found the way to be released from suffering', the Vipassana knowledge that proceeds with even effort, abandoning
        the strong effort to examine formations, is 'Sankharupekkha Nana'. Although devoid of the effort of examining
        formations, this knowledge is stronger than all the previous knowledges. Just as a stone thrown into the sky
        falls towards the earth very fast without effort, this knowledge also proceeds very fast automatically in the
        characteristics such as impermanence of formations.</p>
      <p><b>Anuloma Nana</b></p>
      <p>When Sankharupekkha Nana develops and the time is very close for the Supramundane Path Knowledge to arise, the
        Vipassana knowledge that arises in conformity with the eight Vipassana knowledges such as Udayabbaya Nana and
        the Supramundane Path Knowledge is called 'Anuloma Nana'.</p>
