        <h2>4. Facts to be Known about Dependent Origination</h2><i class="material-icons share-icon"
          file-name="9-4.html">share</i>
      </div>
      <p>In this Dependent Origination, there are three times, twelve factors, twenty modes, three links, four groups,
        three rounds, and two roots. These should also be known for the knowledge of Dependent Origination to be
        complete.</p>
      <p><b>Three Times</b></p>
      <p>Of the factors of Dependent Origination, the two factors Avijja (Ignorance) and Sankhara (Formations) belong to
        the past time. The two factors Jati (Birth) and Jara-Marana (Aging and Death) belong to the future time. The
        eight factors Vinnana (Consciousness), Namarupa (Mentality-Materiality), Salayatana (Sixfold Base), Phassa
        (Contact), Vedana (Feeling), Tanha (Craving), Upadana (Clinging), and Bhava (Becoming) belong to the present
        time. In terms of existence (bhava), Avijja and Sankhara belong to the past existence. Jati and Jara-Marana
        belong to the future existence. The middle eight factors belong to the present existence.</p>
      <p>Just as someone taking a little water from the great ocean shows that the water of the entire great ocean is
        salty, the Tathagata, by showing the present existence completely through 'Avijjā paccayā saṅkhārā' etc., has
        shown the entire Samsara which has no end. When preaching one existence completely, the cause and effect of that
        existence must also be shown. The two factors Avijja and Sankhara are added to Dependent Origination to show the
        cause of the arising of the present existence. The two factors Jati and Jara-Marana are added to show the future
        effect arising from the present existence.</p>
      <p>Here, the Tathagata preached the past causes to eliminate the view that beings arose spontaneously and the view
        that beings were created by a god. The future effects are shown to eliminate the view that there is no birth
        after death. The series of causes and effects is preached to eliminate the self-view.</p>
      <p><b>Twelve Factors</b></p>
      <p>There are twelve factors of Dependent Origination: Ignorance, Formations, Consciousness, Mentality-Materiality,
        Sixfold Base, Contact, Feeling, Craving, Clinging, Becoming, Birth, and Aging-Death. Sorrow etc. are not taken
        as factors of Dependent Origination because they do not occur for everyone.</p>
      <p><b>Four Groups (Summaries)</b></p>
      <p>These twelve factors of Dependent Origination are divided into four parts. Those parts are called summaries
        (sankshepa).</p>
      <p>The two factors Avijja and Sankhara are one summary.</p>
      <p>The five factors Vinnana, Namarupa, Salayatana, Phassa, and Vedana are one summary.</p>
      <p>The three factors Tanha, Upadana, and Bhava are one summary.</p>
      <p>The two factors Jati and Jara-Marana are one summary.</p>
      <p><b>Three Links</b></p>
      <p>There is one link between Sankhara belonging to the past existence and Vinnana belonging to the present
        existence.</p>
      <p>There is one link between Vedana and Tanha of the present existence.</p>
      <p>There is one link between Bhava and Jati.</p>
      <p>Thus, there are three links here. When there are three links, there are four parts.</p>
      <p><b>Twenty Modes</b></p>
      <p>Of the factors of Dependent Origination, Avijja and Sankhara are causes belonging to the past existence. Where
        there are Avijja and Sankhara, the three factors Tanha, Upadana, and Bhava also exist. Since these three are
        also included when Avijja and Sankhara are mentioned, they are not separately preached in the Dependent
        Origination Pali. However, all five - <b>Avijja, Sankhara, Tanha, Upadana, Bhava</b> - should be taken as causes
        belonging to the past existence. The five factors Vinnana, Namarupa, Salayatana, Phassa, and Vedana arising in
        the present existence are the effects of the causes belonging to the past existence. The three factors Tanha,
        Upadana, and Bhava appearing in the Dependent Origination Pali are the causes in the present existence that
        produce the future existence. If there are Tanha, Upadana, and Bhava, there are also Avijja and Sankhara.
        Therefore, all five - Tanha, Upadana, Bhava, Avijja, Sankhara - are taken as present causes. It is stated in the
        Dependent Origination Pali that due to these five causes, Jati and Jara-Marana arise in the future. By Jati and
        Jara-Marana, the five factors <b>Vinnana, Namarupa, Salayatana, Phassa, and Vedana</b> are expressed.</p>
      <p>The five - Avijja, Sankhara, Tanha, Upadana, Bhava - are past causes.</p>
      <p>The five - Vinnana, Namarupa, Salayatana, Phassa, Vedana - are present effects.</p>
      <p>The five - Tanha, Upadana, Bhava, Avijja, Sankhara - are present causes.</p>
      <p>The five - Vinnana, Namarupa, Salayatana, Phassa, Vedana - are future effects.</p>
      <p>These twenty dharmas are called the twenty modes.</p>
      <p>Due to the five causes of the past existence, the five effects of the present existence arise. Due to the five
        causes arising again in the present existence, the five effects belonging to the future existence arise. In the
        future existence too, by the arising of Tanha, Upadana etc. again, another existence is produced by them. Thus,
        Samsara continues unbroken. Since the effect arises from the cause, and the cause again from the effect, this
        series of causes and effects is like a wheel. Therefore, this series of causes and effects is called the
        <b>Cycle of Samsara (Samsara Chakra)</b>.
      </p>
      <p><b>Three Rounds</b></p>
      <p>There are three rounds here. A round (vruttha) is what revolves again and again. Here, the three factors
        Avijja, Tanha, and Upadana are the Round of Defilements (Klesha Vruttha). Kamma Bhava and Sankhara are the Round
        of Kamma (Kamma Vruttha). Upapatti Bhava, Vinnana, Namarupa, Salayatana, Phassa, Vedana, Jati, and Jara-Marana
        are the Round of Results (Vipaka Vruttha). Kamma arises due to defilements. Results arise due to kamma.
        Defilements arise again due to results. Thus, by the revolving of these three - Defilements, Kamma, and Results
        - Samsara continues unbroken.</p>
      <p><b>Two Roots</b></p>
      <p>Ignorance (Avijja) is one root dharma of this cycle of Samsara. Craving (Tanha) is one root dharma. Although
        this series of causes and effects continues like a wheel, if Avijja and Tanha are destroyed, the cycle of
        Samsara is cut off. The cycle of Samsara cannot be escaped by any other method except by destroying these two.
        Therefore, Avijja and Tanha are the root dharmas of this cycle. They are the principal dharmas. The wise destroy
        Avijja and Tanha through practice, escape the cycle of Samsara, and attain Nirvana.</p>
      <p>Because Dependent Origination is preached with Ignorance as the root, it should not be taken that Ignorance is
        the beginning of Samsara. This is not a teaching showing the root or the beginning of the world. This teaching
        shows the method by which Samsara exists. This cycle will continue in the future as well. It existed in the past
        as well. There is no time in the past when this cycle of Samsara did not exist. Therefore, it should be known
        that there is no root which is a beginning here.</p>
