      <p>There are four causes that produce matter namely Kamma - Citta - Utu - Ahara.</p>
      <p>The twenty-five Cittas namely eight Kamavacara Kusala Cittas, five Rupavacara Kusala Cittas, and twelve Akusala
        Cittas, and the Kamma which is the past Kusala-Akusala Cetana that has arisen, produce Rupas in the being's
        continuity at every moment starting from Patisandhi. Those Rupas produced by Kamma are called <b>Kammaja
          Rupas</b>. Here, 'moment' refers to the moments of arising-static-dissolution of Cittas. It produces Rupas at
        the arising moment of the Patisandhi Citta. It produces Rupas at the static and dissolution moments also. It
        produces similarly at the three moments of Cittas arising after the Patisandhi Citta. The arising of Kammaja
        Rupas stops when death is very near. Kammaja Rupas do not arise outside the body of a being. The mansions etc.
        that appear for Devas due to their merit are Utuja Rupas produced with Kamma also as a condition. Since Arupa
        plane is not a place for Rupas, Arupavacara Kusala does not produce Rupas.</p>
      <p>Except for the four Arupa Vipakas and the Dvi-Panca Vinnanas, the remaining seventy-five Cittas are Cittas that
        produce Rupas. These Cittas arise producing Rupas that are produced by themselves. The Citta produces Rupas only
        at the arising moment. At static and dissolution moments, the Citta does not produce Rupas because it is weak.
        Rupas produced by the mind are called <b>Cittaja Rupas</b>.</p>
      <p>Since the Arupa plane is not a place for the arising of Rupas, Arupa Vipaka Cittas do not produce Rupas. Rupas
        are not produced by other Cittas arising in the Arupa plane either. Panca Vinnanas do not produce Rupas because
        those Cittas are weak.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the Patisandhi Citta and the Cuti Citta of Arahants also do not produce Rupas. There is also a
        teacher's view that "Cuti Cittas of all beings do not produce Rupas". Cittaja Rupas start to arise from the
        arising of the first Bhavanga Citta that arises immediately after the Patisandhi Citta. The four Arupa Vipakas,
        Dvi-Panca Vinnanas, Patisandhi Citta, and Cuti Citta of Arahants are Cittas that do not produce Rupas.</p>
      <p>This body does not move by itself. The formless mind is also not capable of moving the body. All actions done
        by the body such as going - coming, lifting - lowering limbs etc. happen by the power of Rupas produced by the
        mind. The body of a person standing stands straight without falling, and the body of a person sitting remains so
        without falling due to the power of Cittaja Rupas.</p>
      <p>Among the seventy-five Cittas that produce Rupas, the twenty-six Mahaggata Lokuttara Javanas called Appana
        Javanas generally not only produce Rupas but also maintain the postures of standing, sitting, lying down without
        breaking. Rupas produced by Appana Javanas are not capable of moving the body. Therefore, making a sleeping body
        stand up and sit, making a sitting body stand up, are not done by Cittaja Rupas produced by Appana Javana. What
        is done by them is maintaining the posture initially created by Cittaja Rupas produced by another mind as it is.
        Not letting it fall down. Cittaja Rupas produced by Bhavanga Cittas are not capable of performing even that
        function. That is why if a person standing or sitting falls asleep, he falls.</p>
      <p>The thirty-two Cittas namely Votthapana, twenty-nine Kamavacara Javanas, and two Abhinna Cittas perform the
        producing of Rupas, maintaining of postures, and also the producing of Kaya and Vaci Vinnattis. Actions like
        going happen by Cittas that produce Vinnatti.</p>
      <p>By the thirteen Somanassas namely four Lobha Mula Somanassa Sahagata Cittas, Hasituppada, and eight Maha Kusala
        Maha Kriya Somanassa Sahagata Cittas, not only the above mentioned things but also smiling is caused.</p>
      <p>Of these thirteen Cittas, Puthujjanas smile with eight: four Lobha Mula Somanassa Sahagata Cittas and four Maha
        Kusala Somanassa Sahagata Cittas. Sekhas smile with two Ditthi Vippayutta Somanassa Sahagata Cittas and four
        Maha Kusala Somanassa Sahagata Cittas. Arahants smile with Hasituppada Citta and four Maha Kriya Somanassa
        Sahagata Cittas.</p>
      <p>The Tejo Dhatu in Rupa Kalapas that have reached the static stage produces another group of Rupas. Tejo Dhatu
        is also called Utu. Therefore, Rupas produced by the Tejo Dhatu in Rupa Kalapas are called <b>Utuja Rupas</b>.
        Tejo Dhatu exists in Utuja Kalapas also. Therefore, it should be known that when Rupa Kalapas produced by all
        four: Kamma-Citta-Utu-Ahara reach the static stage, Utuja Rupas are produced by them. Rupa is not strong at the
        arising moment, but at the static moment. That is why Utu does not produce Rupas at the arising moment.</p>
      <p>When the Ahara called Oja in food and drink etc. enters the body and reaches the static stage, a group of Rupas
        is produced by it also. They are called <b>Aharaja Rupas</b>. The Ahara Rupa called Oja exists in all Rupa
        Kalapas belonging to blood, flesh etc. of the body. Aharaja Rupas are produced by the combination of two types:
        Oja taken from outside and Oja existing in the body. Ojas taken from outside are not capable of producing Rupas
        without the help of bodily Oja. Bodily Oja is also not capable of producing Rupas without the help of Oja taken
        from outside.</p>
      <p>There is also a teacher's view that food taken from outside only helps the bodily Oja to produce Rupas, but
        does not perform the producing of Rupas by itself.</p>
      <p>It is said that Rupas are produced not only by food eaten but also by food applied on the body, and that Rupas
        are produced in the body of the child in the womb by the food eaten by the mother.</p>
