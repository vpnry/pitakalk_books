      </div>
      <p>Vithi diagrams are useful to easily keep Citta Vithis in mind. In drawing Vithi diagrams, three circles are
        used to show the three moments Uppada - Thiti - Bhanga of the mind. Above or below those circles, the names of
        Cittas are marked with a single letter. The letters used to introduce Cittas are as follows.</p>
      <p>Atita Bhavanga <b>Ti</b></p>
      <p>Bhavanga Calana <b>Na</b></p>
      <p>Bhavangupaccheda <b>Da</b></p>
      <p>Pancadvaravajjana <b>Pa</b></p>
      <p>Cakkhuvinnana <b>Ca</b></p>
      <p>Sampaticchana <b>Sam</b></p>
      <p>Santirana <b>Na</b></p>
      <p>Votthapana <b>Vo</b></p>
      <p>Javana <b>Ja</b></p>
      <p>Tadarammana <b>Ta</b></p>
      <p><b>Cakkhudvarika Atimahantarammana Vithi Diagram</b></p>
      <div class="gatha">
        <p>Ti Na Da Pa Ca Sam Na Vo Ja</p>
        <p>ооо ооо ооо ооо ооо ооо ооо ооо ооо</p>
        <p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</p>

      <p>The numbers up to 17 are placed below this to show the seventeen Citta Khanas which is the lifespan of the
        Rupa. In this diagram, the three Cittas with numbers 1, 2, 3 are Bhavanga Cittas. They do not take the Rupa
        struck on the Pasada as object. Everywhere, the object of Bhavanga Cittas is one of the three: Kamma - Kamma
        Nimitta - Gati Nimitta. The Bhavanga Citta shown above number 1 is to show the Citta that arose in the continuum
        of the person in whom the Vithi arises at the moment the Rupa striking the Pasada arises. The Ruparammana which
        has passed one Citta Khana after arising struck the Pasada at the Uppada Khana of the Bhavanga Calana. The first
        Citta arising taking that Rupa as object is Pancadvaravajjana. The fourteen Cittas from Pancadvaravajjana to the
        second Tadarammana are Cittas arising taking the Rupa struck on the Pasada as object.</p>
      <p>Of those fourteen Cittas, what is done by Pancadvaravajjana is turning the Citta lineage towards the
        Ruparammana struck on the Pasada. What sees the Rupa is Cakkhuvinnana. Since Cakkhuvinnana ceases seeing only
        the color, the knowledge about the Rupa struck on the Pasada is not complete just by its arising. To complete
        it, immediately as Cakkhuvinnana ceases, Sampaticchana arises taking the Ruparammana seen by it. Immediately as
        Sampaticchana ceases, Santirana arises investigating the Ruparammana. Immediately as Santirana ceases,
        Votthapana Citta arises judging according to that investigation. After Votthapana ceases, Javana Citta arises
        seven times taking the nature of the Ruparammana well as judged by it. The Citta that takes the object well is
        Javana. Since the Ruparammana exists striking the Cakkhu Pasada even after the cessation of the seventh Javana,
        two Tadarammana Cittas arise taking that object just as taken by the Javana. Seeing the Rupa is completed by the
        Javana Citta. Tadarammana is not a Citta with that much use. It is not a Citta that arises in beings of Rupa and
        Arupa worlds, but only in Kama beings. It should be understood that there is not much use of Tadarammana as
        seeing Rupa etc. happens without deficiency even without Tadarammana for Brahmas.</p>
      <p>The Pancadvaravajjana etc. Cittas arising and ceasing performing their respective functions in this Vithi do
        not know anything other than performing that respective function. A mango simile is given to illustrate this
        Vithi. It is as follows:-</p>
      <p>A man sleeps under a mango tree with mature fruits. A ripe mango fruit falls near his ear. He wakes up by its
        sound. Opens eyes and looks. He takes the mango fruit to hand. Presses the mango fruit to see if it is a ripe
        one. Smells it again to determine if it is a ripe one. Then he eats it. Swallows the remaining part smeared in
        the mouth with saliva. Doing all that, he sleeps again as before.</p>
      <p>In this simile, the time the man was sleeping should be known as the time Bhavanga Cittas were arising. The
        falling of the mango fruit should be known as the Ruparammana striking the Cakkhu Pasada. The man waking up
        should be known as Avarjana Citta. Opening eyes and looking should be known as Cakkhuvinnana. Taking the mango
        fruit to hand should be known as Sampaticchana. Pressing to know if it is a ripe one should be known as
        Santirana. Smelling to determine if it is ripe should be known as Votthapana Citta. Eating the mango fruit
        should be known as Javana Citta. Swallowing the remaining part smeared in the mouth with saliva should be known
        as Tadarammana. Sleeping again should be known as Bhavanga arising again.</p>
