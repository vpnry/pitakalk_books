      <p>The series of Cittas such as Pancadvaravajjana, Cakkhu Vinnana etc. arising regarding seeing forms etc. known
        by the name Citta Vithi cannot be created by those respective persons by their own effort. Nor can they be
        created by the power of anyone such as Devas. If a Cakkhudvara Vithi arises, it arises solely by the striking of
        a Ruparammana on the Cakkhu Pasada. Just as a sound arises if a hand strikes a drum, just as a fire arises if a
        match is rubbed on a matchbox, if a collision of Cakkhu Pasada and Ruparammana occurs, Cakkhudvarika Vithis
        arise.</p>
      <p>There is no one who commands the series of Cittas such as Pancadvaravajjana etc. arising when a Rupa strikes
        the Cakkhu Pasada to arise without disorder, not exceeding the order of Pancadvaravajjana - Cakkhu Vinnana -
        Sampaticchana - Santirana etc. Without such a one, these Cittas arise in order solely by the power of preceding
        Cittas. Because of the arising of a Pancadvaravajjana, Cakkhu Vinnana which is suitable to arise next to it
        arises. Because of the arising of Cakkhu Vinnana, Sampaticchana which is the suitable Citta to arise next to it
        arises. Because of the arising of Sampaticchana etc., Santirana etc. also arise in that order.</p>
      <p><b>Niyama Dharmas</b></p>
      <p>To show that Cittas can arise in order without a commander, the Niyama Dharma talk has been presented by
        ancient teachers.</p>
      <p>It is as follows:-</p>
      <p><b>Bija Niyama, Ritu Niyama, Kamma Niyama, Dharma Niyama, Citta Niyama</b> are the five Niyama Dharmas.</p>
      <p>From a mango seed, not a cashew plant - lime plant - orange plant arises, but only a mango plant arises; from a
        jackfruit seed only a jackfruit plant - from a coconut only a coconut plant etc., trees of that respective
        species arising from those respective seeds; the tip of the chickpea plant turning only towards the north; the
        tip of the sunflower plant turning towards the sun; the coconut having three eyes etc. is Bija Niyama.</p>
      <p>Trees and creepers belonging to respective species bearing shoots - flowers - fruits at the same time is Ritu
        Niyama.</p>
      <p>Arising of a result suitable to respective Kammas is Kamma Niyama.</p>
      <p>The manifestation of signs such as earthquakes at the conception of Great Bodhisattvas in the mother's womb,
        birth from mother's womb - enlightenment - turning the wheel of Dhamma etc. is Dharma Niyama.</p>
      <p>When objects such as Rupa strike Pasadas such as Cakkhu, the arising of the Citta lineage in order without
        anyone's organization is Citta Niyama.</p>
      <p>The five facts mentioned happen according to Niyama Dharmas without anyone's organization.</p>
      <p>There is a convention in the country that "learning Citta Vithi is a difficult task". What is difficult is to
        learn one Vithi first. If one Vithi is understood well by resolving all questions regarding it well, it will be
        possible to learn Citta Vithis without difficulty in the future. Therefore, without hurrying to go forward,
        learn this Atimahantarammana Vithi very well. Understand it well.</p>
