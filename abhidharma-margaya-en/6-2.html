      <p>There are three First Jhana Bhumis: Brahmaparisajjaya, Brahmapurohitaya, and Mahabrahmaya.</p>
      <p>There are three Second Jhana Bhumis: Parittabhaya, Appamanabhaya, and Abhassara.</p>
      <p>There are three Third Jhana Bhumis: Parittasubhaya, Appamanasubhaya, and Subhakinhaka.</p>
      <p>Vehapphalaya, Asannasattaya, and Suddhavasa are the Fourth Jhana Bhumis.</p>
      <p>There are five Suddhavasa Bhumis: Avihaya, Atappaya, Sudassaya, Sudassiya, and Akanitthaya. Thus there are
        sixteen Rupavacara Bhumis.</p>
      <p>There are four Arupavacara Bhumis: Akasanancayatana Bhumi, Vinnanancayatana Bhumi, Akincannayatana Bhumi, and
        Nevasannanasannayatana Bhumi.</p>
      <p>There are thirty-one Bhumis: eleven Kamavacara Bhumis, sixteen Rupavacara Bhumis, and four Arupavacara Bhumis.
      </p>
      <p>The Kama Sugati Bhumis starting from the Human World are situated one above the other in order. Above
        Parinirmitavashavarti, the three First Jhana Bhumis are situated on one plane. Above them, the three Second
        Jhana Bhumis are on one plane, above them the three Third Jhana Bhumis are on one plane, and above them the two
        Fourth Jhana Bhumis, Vehapphala and Asanna Satta, are situated on one plane. Above them, the five Suddhavasa
        Bhumis are situated one above the other. Above them, the four Arupa Bhumis are situated in order.</p>
      <p>Of the thirty-one Bhumis, in the Asanna Bhumi, there is only one aggregate, the Rupakkhandha. Therefore, it is
        called <b>Ekavokara Bhumi</b>. In the Arupa Bhumis, there are only the four Namakkhandhas. Therefore, they are
        called <b>Catuvokara Bhumi</b>. In the eleven Kamavacara Bhumis and the fifteen Rupavacara Bhumis other than the
        Asanna Bhumi, there are all five aggregates (Pancakkhandha). They are called <b>Pancavokara Bhumi</b>.</p>
      <p>Puthujjana persons and Sovan Sakrdagami persons are not found in Suddhavasa Bhumis. Aryas are not found in the
        four Apaya Bhumis and the Asanna Bhumi. In other Bhumis, all persons, both Arya and Puthujjana, are found.</p>
      <p>Only the Duggati Ahetuka person is found in the four Apaya Bhumis. In the Manushya Bhumi and Caturmaharajika,
        all eleven persons other than the Duggati Ahetuka are obtained. In the Deva worlds from Tavatimsa to
        Parinirmitavashavarti, the remaining ten persons excluding the Ahetuka persons are obtained. In the Rupavacara
        Bhumis from Brahmaparisajjaya to Vehapphala, nine persons, namely the Trihetuka Puthujjana and the eight Arya
        persons, are obtained. In the Asanna Bhumi, only the one Sugati Ahetuka person is obtained. In the Suddhavasa
        Bhumis, the three highest Arya persons are obtained. In the Arupa Bhumis, eight persons, namely the Trihetuka
        Puthujjana and the seven Arya persons excluding the Sovan Margastha, are obtained. If the total number of
        persons obtained in each Bhumi is added up, there are two hundred and fourteen persons.</p>
      <p>Lay people in the human world also attain the paths and fruits of Sovan, Sakrdagami, Anagami, and Arhat. Lay
        people who become Arhats either ordain or attain Parinibbana. They do not live as lay people for long. Even if
        Bumatu Devas become Arhats, they live like that as long as their lifespan lasts. Anagamis in Kamavacara Deva
        worlds either go to the Brahma world or attain Arhatship and Parinibbana. There are no suitable places for
        Anagamis and Arhats to live in Deva worlds. All Aryas in Rupavacara and Arupavacara Bhumis live as long as their
        lifespan lasts. Sovan and Sakrdagami persons who have reached Rupavacara Bhumis do not come back to the Kama
        world. Anagamis who have reached the three Bhumis Vehapphala, Akanittha, and Nevasannanasannayatana do not go to
        another place again. They attain Arhatship and Parinibbana in those very Bhumis.</p>
