      <p>To the being dying in any manner, one of the Kusala or Akusala Kammas done by that person in the present life
        or in past lives, or a Kamma Nimitta, or a Gati Nimitta appears. <b>Kamma Nimitta</b> are the objects of the
        Kamma or the instruments used to perform it. To those who have done Kusala Kammas, Bodhi trees, Cetiyas, Buddha
        statues, flowers, lamps, food and drink, clothes etc. appear as Kamma Nimittas. To those who have done Akusala
        Kammas, animals being killed, others' goods, instruments of killing animals, instruments of stealing etc. appear
        as Kamma Nimittas.</p>
      <p><b>Gati Nimitta</b> are things related to the future birth. To beings being born in hell, great flames, molten
        metal, burning coals etc., and Yama Rakkhasas, evil beasts appear. That appearance happens as if those things
        are in those respective places or sometimes as if they have come near oneself. To those being born in Deva
        worlds, divine mansions, chariots, gardens, Kalpa Vrksa etc., and Devas and divine maidens appear as Gati
        Nimitta. To those being born in the human world, the mother's womb appears as Gati Nimitta. To those being born
        in animal wombs, forests etc. appear.</p>
      <p>In the appearance of Kamma etc., Kammas done in the present life and remembered appear to the Mind Door as
        memories. Kammas done in the present life and forgotten, and Kammas done in past lives, and Kamma Nimittas and
        Gati Nimittas appear like seeing dreams. These mostly appear to the Mind Door. Kamma Nimittas and Gati Nimittas
        appear to the Eye Door etc. also when they are present before the dying person. To Arahants who are not born
        again in existence, there is no appearance of Kamma etc. at the moment of death. However death occurs, not a
        single being born in existence dies without one of the three: Kamma, Kamma Nimitta, or Gati Nimitta appearing.
        Even a fly crushed by a hammer dies after one of the three: Kamma etc. appears. By appearing in this way at the
        moment of death, old Kammas that had been buried for a long time become fresh as if done at that very moment.
      </p>
      <p>The mind of the dying being, to whom one of the three: Kamma etc. has appeared, bends towards that appeared
        object and proceeds. The reason for that is the presence of Avijja covering the danger of existence and Tanha
        delighting in existence in him without being eradicated. At this moment, a series of Cittas taking that appeared
        object as object arises in him. If the Kamma presenting itself to give result to him is a Kamma producing birth
        in Apaya, the series of Cittas arising in him at this moment is an impure series of Cittas associated with
        Akusala Javanas. If the Kamma presenting itself to give result is a Kusala Kamma, a pure Kusala Citta series
        arises in him at this moment.</p>
      <p>Cittas arise in a being's body only as long as the Vatthu Rupas produced by past Kamma which support the
        arising of Cittas exist in his body. If the Vatthu Rupa lineage is cut off, thereafter Cittas do not arise in
        that body again. Reaching the state where Cittas do not arise again in the body is death.</p>
      <p>When the Vatthu Rupa lineage supporting Cittas is very close to being cut off, the last Citta Vithi arises in
        that body taking as object one of the Kamma etc. that appeared to the dying being at that moment. It is called
        the Maranasanna Vithi. At this moment, since the Citta force is very weak, seven Javanas do not arise in that
        Vithi as in normal times, but only five arise. Immediately after the fifth Javana, or after a Bhavanga following
        the Javana, or after a Tadarammana, or after a Bhavanga following a Tadarammana, the Cuti Citta which is the
        last Citta of the present life arises. Thereafter, Cittas never arise in that body again. The arising of the
        Cuti Citta is the death of the being.</p>
      <p>Although Cittas do not arise in that body again after Cuti, the being's Citta lineage is not cut off.
        Simultaneously with the cessation of the Cuti Citta, the Patisandhi Citta, which is the first Citta of the
        second life, arises in some place as a result of the Kamma that was present to give result, taking the very same
        object taken by the Maranasanna Javanas. The arising of that Patisandhi Citta is the rebirth of the dead being.
        Nothing goes from the dying person's body to the future life. The Patisandhi Citta is not one that went from the
        present life, but one that arose newly right there.</p>
      <p>Although the Patisandhi Citta is not one that went from the present life to the future life, it belongs to the
        very same Citta lineage existing in the present life. If there were no Citta lineage belonging to the present
        life, a Patisandhi Citta would not arise. There is no long time between Cuti and Patisandhi. The time taken for
        Patisandhi to arise after Cuti is equal to the time taken for one Citta to cease and another to arise in a Citta
        Vithi while living. When a human dies and is conceived in a Deva world, although no one went from this world to
        the Deva world, since the Deva's Patisandhi Citta belongs to the dead human's Citta lineage, the dead human and
        that Deva should be spoken of as one person.</p>
      <p>The main cause for the arising of Patisandhi Citta immediately after Cuti is the past Kamma that has come to
        give result. The Kusala or Akusala Javana Cittas that existed at the moment of death taking one of Kamma etc. as
        object, and Avijja and Tanha also are causes for Patisandhi in their respective ways.</p>
