<p>Abhidhamma Mārgaya (The Path of Abhidhamma) - Ven. Rerukane
Chandawimala Thero</p>
<p>Abhidhamma Mārgaya (The Path of Abhidhamma)</p>
<!-- Source: 1-0.html -->
<p>Introduction - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Since many laypeople and monks who have read the Dhamma books
compiled by us, as well as many who run and teach in Dhamma schools,
have invited us many times to compile an Abhidhamma book that is easy to
understand, learn, and teach, we have compiled this book named
<strong>Abhidhamma Mārgaya</strong> (The Path of Abhidhamma).</p>
<p>Many existing Abhidhamma textbooks are difficult to understand
because they have translated Pali phrases from the sub-commentaries
(Ṭīkā) word-for-word into Sinhala and inserted them in various places.
In compiling this book, <em>Abhidhamma Mārgaya</em>, we did not follow
that method.</p>
<p>We have compiled this book in a manner that we felt would allow
students to understand each fact easily. Nothing translated from another
language has been included in this book. Here are a few examples to
understand the difference between this book and other Abhidhamma
textbooks:</p>
<p>In one Abhidhamma textbook, <em>Citta</em> (Consciousness), one of
the four Ultimate Realities (Paramattha), is introduced as follows:
“Thinking is <em>Citta</em> (cintetīti cittaṃ), it is called Citta
because it thinks of an object. In this sense of the word, the nature
that thinks of objects is called Citta.”</p>
<p>In another book, Citta is introduced as follows: “Citta is that which
thinks, or cognizes objects. Although there are other causes for the
arising of a mind, know that cognizing the object is the principal
cause.”</p>
<p><strong>In this book, Citta is introduced as follows:</strong> “Among
the four Ultimate Realities, <em>Citta</em> means knowing. It is also
called the mind.”</p>
<p>How <em>Cetasika</em> (Mental Factors) is introduced in one book:
“That which is in the mind is <em>Cetasika</em> (cetasi bhavaṃ
cetasikaṃ). In this sense of the word, the group of natural phenomena
such as <em>Phassa</em> (Contact), <em>Vedanā</em> (Feeling), etc., that
arise in the mind are called Cetasikas.”</p>
<p>In another book: “Those that are in the mind, or associated with the
mind, are Cetasikas.”</p>
<p><strong>In this book, Cetasikas are introduced as follows:</strong>
“When a <em>Citta</em> or knowing of an object arises, the other
activities that arise mixed with that act of knowing are Cetasikas.”</p>
<p>How <em>Rūpa</em> (Matter) is introduced in one book: “It is
deformed, thus it is <em>Rūpa</em> (ruppatīti rūpaṃ). In this sense of
the word, the group of natural phenomena that are deformed by cold,
heat, etc., is called Rūpa.”</p>
<p>In another book: “That which undergoes deformation by cold, heat,
etc., is Rūpa.”</p>
<p><strong>In this book, Rūpa is shown as:</strong> “The group of
fundamental elements out of which the bodies of beings and external
objects are made are Rūpas.”</p>
<p>How <em>Nibbāna</em> is introduced in one book: “That which has
departed from the weaving (craving) is <em>Nibbāna</em> (vānato
nikkhantaṃ nibbānaṃ). The nature that has departed from craving, which
is called ‘vāna’ (weaving/entanglement), is named Nibbāna. Here, ‘vāna’
refers to craving in the sense that it ties and binds together small and
large existences.”</p>
<p>In another book, Nibbāna is introduced as: “‘Vāna’ is craving. That
which has departed from the craving known as ‘vāna’ is Nibbāna. Or, that
which extinguishes the fires of lust, etc., is Nibbāna.”</p>
<p><strong>In this book, Nibbāna is introduced as:</strong> “The
peaceful, blissful nature that is free from the fires of defilements
such as lust, etc., and the fires of suffering such as birth, decay,
disease, and death, is Nibbāna.”</p>
<p>All lessons herein have been compiled using words commonly used by
the general public as much as possible. Uncommon words have been used
only where common words could not be found. Therefore, this book will be
easier to read and understand than other existing books. An industrious
person will be able to learn Abhidhamma from this book even without the
association of a teacher.</p>
<p>Almost all Abhidhamma textbooks currently in use are compiled
according to the <strong>Abhidhammattha Saṅgaha</strong>. This too has
been compiled in the same way. However, since this was compiled for the
virtuous people studying to gain a general knowledge of Abhidhamma,
certain facts mentioned in the Abhidhammattha Saṅgaha, which would cause
much exhaustion to the learner without much benefit, have not been
included in this book. Likewise, certain facts included in other
Abhidhamma textbooks that are not of much use have also not been
included in this book.</p>
<p>In some places, useful facts not included in other Abhidhamma
textbooks have been included in this book. Further practice of analyzing
specific characteristics is needed to facilitate the learning of
Abhidhamma treatises (Pakaraṇa). For virtuous people who do not intend
to study that far, practicing further analysis of characteristics brings
weariness rather than special benefit. Therefore, further analysis of
characteristics has not been included in this book.</p>
<p><strong>Only the facts that must necessarily be known by someone
acquiring general knowledge of the Dhamma have been included in this
book.</strong> Therefore, this book does not contain as many facts as
other Abhidhamma textbooks. The book has become large because the
included facts have been explained in a manner that makes them easy to
understand. In some places here, the order of presenting facts has also
been changed from the Abhidhammattha Saṅgaha. These changes are mostly
in the fourth, eighth, and ninth chapters. Such changes were made to
facilitate learning. Learning Abhidhamma from this book will be somewhat
easier than learning it from another book.</p>
<p>No matter how simple the words used are, or how easily the book is
compiled for learning, if the learner tries to learn this deep Dhamma by
the wrong method, it cannot be learned. <strong>The method to learn is
to learn in order, without skipping a single lesson.</strong> One should
not proceed without gaining knowledge of the initial lessons and initial
chapters. Abhidhamma textbooks are compiled with a connection from
lesson to lesson, from chapter to chapter. Therefore, one who cannot
master the first chapter cannot learn the second chapter. One who cannot
master those two cannot learn the third chapter. One who cannot master
those three chapters cannot learn the fourth chapter. The method is the
same until the end.</p>
<p>Learning becomes tedious for the person who proceeds to higher
chapters without knowledge of the initial chapters and without
remembering the facts of the initial chapters, because they cannot
understand anything in those chapters. Many who start learning
Abhidhamma give up learning after a short while because they proceed
without knowing the facts of the initial chapters. For those who proceed
learning while mastering and remembering the facts of the initial
chapters well, this Dhamma becomes more and more interesting from
chapter to chapter. To succeed in learning, to obtain knowledge of
Dhamma and the taste of Dhamma, one must learn systematically.</p>
<p><strong>One often hears about the difficulty of teaching Abhidhamma
lessons in Dhamma schools.</strong> Many think that teaching has become
difficult due to faults in the textbooks. While there is some truth to
that, it is not the whole truth. Abhidhamma is a very deep science. Even
a shallow science can be taught well to another only by someone who has
a complete knowledge of that science. Teachers with complete knowledge
are not to be found in Dhamma schools. Therefore, teachers who have
learned other subjects have had to teach Abhidhamma lessons in Dhamma
schools as well. It is no wonder that teaching Abhidhamma lessons is
difficult for those teachers. It is something to be expected.</p>
<p>No matter how many weaknesses there are in textbooks, a learned
teacher can teach the subject well without error. The true reason for
the difficulty in teaching Abhidhamma lessons is the weakness of the
teachers. Those teachers should be praised for teaching Abhidhamma
lessons in Dhamma schools, even with difficulty, without giving up due
to difficulties. If Abhidhamma teaching is continued in Dhamma schools
without stopping, even with difficulty, those difficulties can be
overcome in time.</p>
<p><strong>Abhidhamma lessons can be taught well only by a teacher who
has a complete knowledge of Abhidhamma.</strong> A teacher who has a
complete knowledge of the Abhidhammattha Saṅgaha or a similar book can
also teach Abhidhamma lessons reasonably well. A teacher teaching
Abhidhamma lessons should at least know the few lessons preceding the
lesson being taught that day in the Abhidhamma textbook. One who does
not have even that much knowledge cannot teach Abhidhamma lessons at
all.</p>
<p><strong>A Method to Easily Become an Abhidhamma Teacher</strong></p>
<p>Teaching is a very good way to improve knowledge. When a lesson is
taught to a group of students, the teacher gains a higher knowledge than
the knowledge gained by that group of students. Since this book,
<strong>Abhidhamma Mārgaya</strong>, is prepared in a way that is easy
to teach, if a teacher teaches a group of students from the beginning,
they will be able to teach without much difficulty. Knowledge will be
gained by the teacher through teaching itself. If passed lessons are
forgotten, it will be difficult to teach further. Therefore, passed
lessons should be read repeatedly to prevent forgetting.</p>
<p><strong>Without knowledge of passed lessons</strong>, no benefit can
be gained by reading future lessons. Without going to search for future
lessons, special attention should always be paid to passed lessons. If
any difficulty arises for a person teaching in this way, it comes in the
eighth chapter. If the eighth chapter were written to be easily
understood, it would be too long to be suitable for a textbook.
Therefore, the facts of the eighth chapter have been explained to a
certain extent. Lack of knowledge of the eighth chapter is not a
hindrance to learning and teaching the ninth chapter. <strong>Everyone
can benefit from the ninth chapter here. It describes meditation
methods.</strong> If this book is taught two or three times as stated by
a certain teacher, that person will effortlessly become a good
Abhidhamma teacher.</p>
<p><strong>Ultimate realities (Paramattha Dhammas) are very
subtle.</strong> It is very difficult to write explaining the nature of
Dhammas so that one can read and understand them. When compiling a
textbook, another difficulty is added to that difficulty. If one writes
at great length using many words, even a very deep fact can be written
so it is understandable. There is no room to do so when providing
textbooks. When sentences are shortened to be suitable for a lesson, the
matter becomes unclear. This is the difficulty in providing lessons.
Since it is very difficult to write briefly yet in a way that the matter
can be understood, greater effort had to be taken in compiling this book
than the effort taken in writing another book. Whether it has been
successful or not will be known in the future.</p>
<p>A book like this needs to be examined and edited several times to be
perfect. What is printed here is our first script. It is not impossible
for there to be various shortcomings. They are best seen by the virtuous
people who read and teach. If any omission, excess, lack of clarity, or
error is seen anywhere here, we request everyone to inform us of it.</p>

<h2 id="the-importance-of-abhidhamma">1. The Importance of
Abhidhamma</h2>
<p>The Dhamma that analyzes and shows the fundamental elements (dhātus)
that make up all beings small and large, such as gods, humans,
elephants, horses, cattle, flies, and mosquitoes, and all objects such
as earth, stones, water, wind, trees, and creepers; and teaches how
those fundamental elements arise and exist as a continuity; and analyzes
and shows the element of Nibbána, is the
<strong>Abhidhamma</strong>.</p>
<p>It is by learning Abhidhamma that one can correctly know that these
humans and other beings currently living existed in the past as well,
that they will be born again and again after death, and how rebirth
occurs.</p>
<p>It is by learning Abhidhamma that one can correctly understand that
there are things called merit (puñña) and things called demerit (pāpa),
the power in those merits and demerits, and how merit and demerit give
happiness and suffering to beings.</p>
<p>It is also by learning Abhidhamma that one can correctly know what
are merits and what are demerits.</p>
<p>It is by learning Abhidhamma that one can know there are many beings
belonging to various classes such as Devas and Brahmas, with various
forms and various modes of happiness and suffering, whom our eyes cannot
see, both near us and far away from us.</p>
<p>It is also by learning Abhidhamma that one can correctly understand
what Nibbāna is and what the path to Nibbāna is.</p>
<p>It is because of not knowing this Dhamma that one does not accept
that there is future birth, does not accept that beings receive
happiness and suffering according to kamma, and does not accept that
there are hells and gods and Brahmas.</p>
<p>Wrong views such as “there is no need to worship Buddha statues,”
“there is no need to offer flowers, lights, and food to the non-living
Buddha,” arise also because of not knowing this Dhamma.</p>
<p>Even if one is a Buddhist, the person who does not know this Dhamma
at least to some extent is a blind worldling (andhabāla puthujjana). He
cannot understand well by listening to a sermon or reading a Dhamma
book. To understand a spoken sermon well, and to understand a Dhamma
book well by reading it, one must have learned Abhidhamma at least to
some extent.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s Dhamma is divided into three parts: Sutta Piṭaka, Vinaya
Piṭaka, and Abhidhamma Piṭaka. The Abhidhamma Piṭaka consists of seven
books (Pakaraṇa).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Dhammasaṅganī Pakaraṇa</li>
<li>Vibhaṅga Pakaraṇa</li>
<li>Dhātukathā Pakaraṇa</li>

<li>Kathāvatthu Pakaraṇa</li>
<li>Yamaka Pakaraṇa</li>
<li>Paṭṭhāna Pakaraṇa</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the names of the seven books.</p>

<li>Ultimate Reality (Paramattha) and Concept (Paññatti) - Abhidhamma
Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ultimate-reality-paramattha-and-concept-paññatti">2. Ultimate
Reality (Paramattha) and Concept (Paññatti)</h2>
<p>Abhidhamma is the Tathāgata’s teaching on Ultimate Reality.
Therefore, the person learning Abhidhamma must first learn what Ultimate
Reality (Paramattha) is.</p>
<p>“Meaning” (Artha) is what is felt by the mind or grasped by the mind
through hearing spoken words, seeing written or printed things and
various other things, and thinking. This word “Artha” is synonymous with
the word “everything.” There is nothing in the world that is not an
“Artha.” There are many “Arthas” in the world. Their quantity cannot be
shown in any way.</p>
<p>Among things felt by the mind as existing, there are things that
truly exist. There are also things that do not truly exist. The vast
majority of things that appear to the world as existing and are felt as
existing are things that do not exist in truth.</p>
<p>If someone in the dark takes a firebrand and whirls it rapidly, a
circle of fire appears to those looking from a distance. However, there
is only the firebrand there; the circle of fire that appears to exist is
not there. That circle of fire is something that appears as if it exists
due to the rapid movement of the firebrand.</p>
<p>Tables, chairs, beds, clothes, houses, plates, cups, humans, cattle,
dogs, elephants, etc., which are considered by the world as existing,
are all, like the circle of fire, things that do not truly exist.</p>
<p>Whether something considered as existing exists in truth or not can
be known by analyzing that thing. A table is one thing considered to
exist. If it is analyzed, it is seen that there are four legs, four
planks connecting the four legs, and two or three planks on the top.
None of those single items is the table. There is no table apart from
that group of materials. It can be said that all those materials are the
table. All are not the table either. If all were the table, however they
were placed, those pieces of wood should be the table. If the pieces of
wood are separated from each other or joined in another way, then a
table is not seen. Therefore, know that all those pieces of wood are not
the table either. Since the pieces of wood are a pile of wood pieces and
not a table, know that there is no such thing as a table in truth.
“Table” is a mere notion formed according to the way the pieces of wood
are positioned.</p>
<p>All inanimate objects such as beds, chairs, tables, plates, cups,
clothes, trees, creepers, etc., and animate objects such as gods,
humans, elephants, horses, cattle, etc., considered by the world as
existing, are, like the table, things that do not truly exist. The name
used for things that are considered as existing through mere notion,
while not existing in truth, is <strong>Concept (Paññatti)</strong>.</p>
<p>Of the two, the meaning that does not exist in truth and the meaning
that exists in truth, since the meaning that exists in truth is
superior, it is called Ultimate Reality (<strong>Paramattha</strong>).
The meaning of the word <strong>Paramattha</strong> is “highest meaning”
or “superior thing.”</p>
<p>To know whether something felt as existing is an Ultimate Reality or
a Concept, one must separate that thing into parts and look. If
something disappears when separated into parts like the table, that
thing is not an Ultimate Reality, i.e., not something that exists in
truth. The indivisible thing that remains at the end when objects are
repeatedly divided and examined is the Ultimate Reality.</p>
<p>When it is said that apart from the pieces of wood obtained by
dividing the table, there is no table in truth, you might think that the
pieces of wood, which are parts of the table, are things that exist in
truth. Those pieces of wood are also things that can be further divided.
Therefore, they too should not be considered as Ultimate Realities
(Paramattha Dhammas).</p>
<p>The sawdust seen when a piece of wood is polished with sandpaper are
small parts of the wood. If one is taken separately, that wood particle,
which is small enough not to be seen by the eye, can also be further
divided. Therefore, do not take even that sawdust as Ultimate Realities.
Ultimate Reality is the indivisible meaning obtained at the end of
division.</p>

<li>The Four Ultimate Realities - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-four-ultimate-realities">3. The Four Ultimate Realities</h2>
<p>When this world containing beings is analyzed very subtly, the very
subtle natures obtained at the very end are the Ultimate Realities
(Paramattha Dhammas). The fundamental elements of everything belonging
to the world are the Ultimate Realities. They are energies/forces, not
substances like stones or clay lumps. Therefore, they do not have shapes
such as long, short, small, large, round, square, etc.</p>
<p>When speaking briefly, there are four Ultimate Realities:
<strong>Consciousness (Citta), Mental Factors (Cetasika), Matter (Rūpa),
and Nibbāna</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Consciousness (Citta)</strong></p>
<p>Among the four Ultimate Realities, <em>Citta</em> means knowing. It
is also called the mind. That knowing arises due to the five faculties:
eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and due to the pure mind-door. The knowing
that arises due to the eye is called seeing, and the knowing that arises
due to the ear is called hearing. The words seeing, looking, thinking,
appearing of ideas refer to <strong>Citta</strong> or
<strong>Mind</strong>. The things that are felt are called
<strong>Objects (Ārammaṇa)</strong>. A <strong>Citta</strong> never
arises without the connection of an object. Just as distinct drum sounds
arise from the strokes when a drum is beaten, distinct Cittas arise
regarding those objects when objects impinge on the faculties. All those
knowings are actions. Therefore, all arisen Cittas perish immediately.
It should be remembered that mere knowing is Citta or the mind.</p>
<p><strong>Mental Factors (Cetasika)</strong></p>
<p>When a Citta or knowing of an object arises, the other actions that
arise mixed with that act of knowing are Cetasikas. There are fifty-two
Cetasikas. Arising together with the Citta, perishing together, taking
the very object taken by the Citta, and having the very base that is the
support for the Citta as its support—these four facts are the common
characteristics of Cetasikas. Cetasikas never arise separate from the
Citta. They do not have the power to arise without a Citta. The Citta
also does not have the power to arise completely devoid of Cetasikas.
However, Citta arises without some Cetasikas. A single Citta does not
arise with all Cetasikas.</p>
<p><strong>Matter (Rūpa)</strong></p>
<p>The group of fundamental elements out of which the bodies of beings
and external objects are made are Rūpas. There are twenty-eight Rūpas.
Of them, only one Rūpa, the colour element (vaṇṇa dhātu), is visible to
the eye. The remaining twenty-seven are not Rūpas visible to the eye.
The meaning of the word Rūpa is “that which undergoes deformation upon
contact with adverse things such as cold and heat.” Since Citta and
Cetasikas are very subtle, no collision occurs between them and cold,
heat, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Nibbāna</strong></p>
<p>The peaceful, blissful nature that is free from the fires of
defilements such as lust, etc., and the fires of suffering such as
birth, decay, disease, and death, is Nibbāna. The Ultimate Realities of
Citta, Cetasika, and Rūpa are phenomena that arise solely due to the
gathering of causes suitable for producing that respective Dhamma.
<strong>Because they are produced by conditions, they are called
Conditioned Realities (Saṅkhata Dhammas).</strong> Conditioned Realities
perish without remaining even for a moment after arising. Therefore,
they are Impermanent Realities (Anicca Dhammas). The element of Nibbāna
is a Dhamma that exists without being produced by any cause. Therefore,
it is called the Unconditioned Element (Asaṅkhata Dhātu). It is a Dhamma
that never perishes and exists at all times. It is a very deep Dhamma.
It is a Dhamma that can be realized only with great effort. By
cultivating the Supramundane Path and realizing it, Noble Ones (Ariyas)
are freed from the suffering of Saṃsāra. The highest thing to be
expected by practicing according to Buddhism is that Nibbāna.</p>

<li>The Classification of Consciousness - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-classification-of-consciousness">4. The Classification of
Consciousness</h2>
<p>It was stated above that there are four Ultimate Realities:
Consciousness (Citta), Mental Factors (Cetasika), Matter (Rūpa), and
Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Of those four, one must first learn about Citta. Citta is generally
one. However, Abhidhamma cannot be taught by taking it as one. To make
the nature of the mind teachable, in this Dhamma, it is divided into
(89) eighty-nine in one method, and (121) one hundred and twenty-one in
another method. Citta is divided by plane (bhūmi), kind (jāti), etc.</p>
<p><strong>The Four Classes of Citta: Sense-sphere, etc.</strong></p>
<p>Citta, which is generally one, is divided into four based on planes:
<strong>Sense-sphere (Kāmāvacara)</strong> Citta,
<strong>Fine-material-sphere (Rūpāvacara)</strong> Citta,
<strong>Immaterial-sphere (Arūpāvacara)</strong> Citta, and
<strong>Supramundane (Lokuttara)</strong> Citta.</p>
<p>The four woeful planes (apāyas), the human world, and the six
heaveans—these eleven planes are called the Sense-sphere Plane (Kāma
Bhūmi). The consciousness that belongs to the Sense-sphere Plane due to
arising mostly in those elevenfold Sense-sphere Planes is called
Sense-sphere (Kāmāvacara).</p>
<p>The consciousness that belongs to the Fine-material Plane due to
arising mostly in the fifteenfold Fine-material Planes is called
Fine-material-sphere (Rūpāvacara).</p>
<p>The consciousness that belongs to the Immaterial Plane due to arising
mostly in the four Immaterial Planes is called Immaterial-sphere
(Arūpāvacara).</p>
<p>Although a Supramundane Plane is mentioned, there is no place called
Supramundane Plane. In this classification of consciousness, the
Supramundane Dhammas themselves are called the Supramundane Plane. The
consciousness that belongs to the Supramundane Plane, which does not
belong to the three mentioned planes, is called Supramundane
(Lokuttara).</p>
<p>Certain Sense-sphere Cittas arise in Fine-material and Immaterial
Planes as well. Likewise, certain Fine-material and Immaterial-sphere
Cittas arise in the Sense-sphere Plane. These Cittas have been given
names like Sense-sphere, etc., considering their arising mostly in those
respective planes. Even when a Sense-sphere Citta arises in
Fine-material or Immaterial planes, it is still called by the name
Sense-sphere. Even when Fine-material and Immaterial-sphere Cittas arise
in the Sense-sphere Plane, they are called by the names
Fine-material-sphere and Immaterial-sphere. Supramundane Cittas arise in
all three planes: Sense, Fine-material, and Immaterial. However, since
those Cittas do not belong to those planes, the name Supramundane itself
is used for them.</p>
<p>The meaning of Sense-sphere (Kāmāvacara) Citta is the consciousness
that mostly arises in the Sense World.</p>
<p>The meaning of Fine-material-sphere (Rūpāvacara) Citta is the
consciousness that mostly arises in the Fine-material World.</p>
<p>The meaning of Immaterial-sphere (Arūpāvacara) Citta is the
consciousness that mostly arises in the Immaterial World.</p>
<p>The meaning of Supramundane (Lokuttara) Citta is the consciousness
that transcends the world and stands having transcended the world.</p>
<p>Sense-sphere Cittas, etc., are divided by other methods as well. The
methods of division will be known in respective places. When divided
thus, there are (54) fifty-four Sense-sphere Cittas. There are (15)
fifteen Fine-material-sphere Cittas. There are (12) twelve
Immaterial-sphere Cittas. Supramundane Cittas are (8) eight by the brief
method, and (40) forty by the detailed method. When all are added
together, there are (89) eighty-nine by the brief method. By the
detailed method, there are (121) one hundred and twenty-one.</p>

<h2 id="the-54-sense-sphere-cittas">5. The 54 Sense-Sphere Cittas</h2>
<p>Twelve Unwholesome Cittas, eighteen Rootless Cittas, and twenty-four
Sense-Sphere Beautiful Cittas make up the fifty-four Sense-Sphere
Cittas.</p>
<p><strong>Unwholesome Cittas (Akusala Citta)</strong></p>
<p>Cittas which, if arisen in someone’s continuity, produce undesirable
results for him in the future, are called Unwholesome Cittas.</p>
<p>There are three unwholesome roots called Greed (Lobha), Hatred
(Dosa), and Delusion (Moha). These three are three Cetasikas. The
unwholesome consciousness, which is generally one, is divided into three
as Greed-Rooted Consciousness, Hatred-Rooted Consciousness, and
Delusion-Rooted Consciousness based on association with qualities like
greed.</p>
<p><strong>The Eight Greed-Rooted Cittas (Lobhamūla Citta)</strong></p>
<p>Greed (Lobha) is the nature of attaching to various things and
persons, thinking “this thing is good, beautiful, sweet.” Desire, want,
lust, greediness, attachment, affection, love—all these words refer to
Greed itself. The consciousness associated with that greed is again
divided into two as Joy-Accompanied Consciousness (Somanassa-sahagata
Citta) and Equanimity-Accompanied Consciousness (Upekkhā-sahagata
Citta).</p>
<p>It was stated above that Citta is the knowing arising regarding
something. In this Dhamma, the name given to the thing felt by the mind
is <strong>Object (Ārammaṇa)</strong>. Since one Citta is felt by
another Citta, Citta is also an object. Every object has one of three
qualities: goodness, badness, or neutrality. Those qualities are called
the taste of the object. If a Citta arises taking any object, a nature
that partakes of or experiences the taste of that object also arises
bound with that Citta. The nature arising with the Citta that
experiences the sweetness of the object is called Pleasant Feeling
(Somanassa Vedanā); the nature that experiences the neutrality of the
object is called Equanimity Feeling (Upekkhā Vedanā); and the nature
that experiences the badness of the object is called Unpleasant Feeling
(Domanassa Vedanā). <strong>A consciousness associated with greed is
never associated with unpleasant feeling.</strong> When a Greed-Rooted
Citta arises, it arises together with the feeling of either the goodness
or the neutrality of the object.</p>
<p>Based on the two factors—experiencing the goodness of the object or
experiencing the neutrality—the Greed-Rooted Citta is divided into two:
<strong>Joy-Accompanied Consciousness</strong> and
<strong>Equanimity-Accompanied Consciousness</strong>. Joy-Accompanied
Consciousness is the consciousness associated with pleasant feeling.
Equanimity-Accompanied Consciousness is the consciousness associated
with equanimous feeling. Happiness/Pleasure (Satuṭa) is another name
used for pleasant feeling.</p>
<p>Each of these two Cittas is again divided into two. That is as
follows: Sometimes this Greed-Rooted Joy-Accompanied Consciousness is
associated with wrong view occurring as “there is no merit or demerit,
there is no result of merit or demerit, there is no other world,
whatever is done is not wrong,” etc. Sometimes it is not associated with
wrong view. View is also called <em>Diṭṭhigata</em>. Of the two
Greed-Rooted Cittas mentioned above, the Joy-Accompanied Consciousness
is divided into two based on being associated or not associated with
view: <strong>Joy-Accompanied Consciousness Associated with Wrong View
(Somanassa-sahagata Diṭṭhigata-sampayutta Citta)</strong> and
<strong>Joy-Accompanied Consciousness Dissociated from Wrong View
(Somanassa-sahagata Diṭṭhigata-vippayutta Citta)</strong>. The
Equanimity-Accompanied Consciousness is also similarly divided into two:
<strong>Equanimity-Accompanied Consciousness Associated with Wrong
View</strong> and <strong>Equanimity-Accompanied Consciousness
Dissociated from Wrong View</strong>. By this division, there are four
Greed-Rooted Cittas.</p>
<p>The first of those four Cittas, the Joy-Accompanied Consciousness
Associated with Wrong View, is again divided into two. That is as
follows: Sometimes that Citta arises naturally (spontaneously).
Sometimes it arises through the prompting of another or through
self-inducement or inducement by another. The Citta arising without
prompting or inducement is called <strong>Unprompted
(Asaṅkhārika)</strong> Citta, and the Citta arising with prompting or
inducement is called <strong>Prompted (Sasaṅkhārika)</strong> Citta. The
remaining three Cittas are also divided into two each by the distinction
of prompting (Saṅkhāra). When divided thus, there are eight Greed-Rooted
Cittas. Those eight Cittas are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>One consciousness, accompanied by joy, associated with wrong view,
unprompted.</li>
<li>One consciousness, accompanied by joy, associated with wrong view,
prompted.</li>
<li>One consciousness, accompanied by joy, dissociated from wrong view,

Greed-Rooted Cittas Arise</h2>
<p>The seven unwholesome courses of kamma—stealing, sexual misconduct,
lying, slandering, frivolous talk, covetousness, and wrong view—are
performed by Greed-Rooted Cittas.</p>
<p>Furthermore, drinking intoxicants, gambling, taking bribes, giving
bribes, dancing and watching dances for enjoyment, playing and listening
to music, singing and listening to songs, applying perfumes to the body
for enjoyment, wearing and adorning with beautiful clothes, eating
delicious food for enjoyment, drinking sweet drinks, looking at
beautiful things for enjoyment, playing sports, watching sports, doing
various things to earn wealth, obtaining wealth, protecting obtained
wealth, giving wealth to obtain loved objects, preparing loved objects
such as clothes, jewelry, houses, vehicles, and using them—in these
instances, mostly Greed-Rooted Cittas arise.</p>
<p>When young men and women see each other, speak with each other, deal
with each other; when husbands and wives see each other, speak
pleasantly; when providing beautiful clothes and ornaments to wives and
children—mostly Greed-Rooted Cittas arise. When going on pleasure trips,
mostly Greed-Rooted Cittas arise. When nourishing children, fondling
them, arranging marriages for them—mostly Greed-Rooted Cittas arise. It
must be said that for ordinary people living away from the Dhamma, the
greater part of the thoughts arising throughout the day until sleep are
Greed-Rooted Cittas.</p>
<p>For those who earn wealth etc. with faith, loving-kindness, and
compassion as the forerunner, unwholesome Cittas do not arise in those
activities. For one who earns wealth, protects wealth, spends, provides
clothes and food, dresses, eats and drinks with wisdom as the
forerunner, considering the benefits etc., unwholesome Cittas do not
arise either.</p>
<p>For the one preparing food and the one eating it with the expectation
of taste or with the expectation of beautifying the body etc.,
Greed-Rooted Cittas arise.</p>
<p>For the one preparing food with the expectation of alleviating hunger
and maintaining life, unwholesome Cittas do not arise.</p>
<p>When preparing clothes and ornaments and wearing and adorning with
them with the expectation of becoming beautiful, winning others’ hearts,
or appearing as a high-class person, Greed-Rooted Cittas arise.</p>
<p>For the one preparing clothes and wearing them with the hope of
covering parts that are shameful to see, eliminating cold, eliminating
heat, and protecting from flies and mosquitoes, unwholesome Cittas do
not arise.</p>
<p>When preparing and wearing a beautiful dress or a valuable dress with
the hope of escaping the contempt of onlookers due to the dress not
being beautiful, unwholesome Cittas do not arise.</p>
<p>When giving food to animals and small children to enjoy watching them
eat, Greed-Rooted Cittas arise. When giving food to animals as a favour
(anugraha), wholesome Cittas arise.</p>
<p>When catching beautiful animals upon seeing them, and when feeding
them to watch their beauty, Greed-Rooted Cittas arise.</p>

Greed-Rooted Cittas arising as attachment to wife, children, wealth etc.
are weak. Their giving of results is also indefinite. The unwholesome
Citta associated with view is stronger than the Citta dissociated from
view. The unprompted Citta is stronger than the prompted Citta. The
joy-accompanied Citta is stronger than the equanimity-accompanied
Citta.</p>

<li>The Two Hatred-Rooted Cittas - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-two-hatred-rooted-cittas">8. The Two Hatred-Rooted
Cittas</h2>
<p>Hatred (<em>Dosa</em>) is the nature of opposition arising towards
the object taken by the mind. It is the nature of disliking the object.
Anger, wrath, malice, fear, disgust, dissatisfaction—these words also
refer to Hatred. Since it arises as if striking against the object, it
is also called “<strong>Aversion</strong>” (<em>Paṭigha</em>). The
Hatred-Rooted Consciousness is not divided by way of feeling like the
Greed-Rooted Consciousness. It is always associated with Unpleasant
Feeling (<em>Domanassa Vedanā</em>). Unpleasant feeling is the nature of
experiencing the bad quality of the object. Grief (<em>Soka</em>) also
refers to unpleasant feeling. The Hatred-Rooted Consciousness is divided
only by way of prompting (<em>Saṅkhāra</em>).</p>
<p>There are two Hatred-Rooted Cittas:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Consciousness accompanied by displeasure, associated with
aversion, unprompted.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Consciousness accompanied by displeasure, associated with
aversion, prompted.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The first consciousness arises when doing killing etc. by one’s own
will without anyone’s prompting. The second consciousness arises when
doing killing etc. with prompting.</p>
<p>Even when killing animals laughingly for sport, it is Hatred-Rooted
Cittas that arise. The hatred arising in such instances is subtle. The
hatred arising when killing an enemy coming to harm oneself is fierce.
One should not misunderstand that there is no hatred when killing
animals laughingly for sport.</p>
<p><strong>Occasions where Hatred-Rooted Cittas Arise</strong></p>
<p>Hatred-Rooted Cittas arise through the performance of the seven
unwholesome courses of kamma: killing, harsh speech, ill will, stealing,
lying, slandering, and frivolous talk.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when speaking ill of others, when listening to such
talk, when hearing one’s own faults being spoken of, when hearing one’s
shortcomings/weaknesses being spoken of, when servants etc. are
disobedient, when seeing others doing wrong, when thinking others will
do wrong, when seeing others touching things one protects with care,
when others ask for things one is attached to, when others do not give
things one asks for, when others do not do the work one tells them to
do, when others do not accept one’s word, when others act as enemies
towards oneself, when seeing enemies, when remembering enmity done to
oneself—Hatred-Rooted Cittas arise in many people.</p>
<p>When a loved one such as a parent or child dies, when other losses
occur, when great wrongs are committed by oneself—Hatred-Rooted Cittas
arise as grieving.</p>
<p>When seeing those who eat and drink, dress and adorn themselves
better than oneself, when seeing those travelling in good vehicles, when
seeing those living in good houses, when seeing those receiving respect
and honour—Hatred-Rooted Cittas arise accompanied by envy.</p>
<p>For some who are constantly looking for, speaking of, and thinking of
the faults of others, many hatred-rooted unwholesome Cittas arise each
day.</p>

<li>The Two Delusion-Rooted Cittas - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-two-delusion-rooted-cittas">9. The Two Delusion-Rooted
Cittas</h2>
<p>Delusion (<em>Moha</em>) is a certain nature that darkens the mind so
that when thinking of a certain fact, that fact cannot be known
correctly. It is generally present in all unwholesome Cittas. It is
present strongly in the Delusion-Rooted Consciousness. The
Delusion-Rooted Consciousness is divided by the two Cetasikas: Doubt
(<em>Vicikicchā</em>) and Restlessness (<em>Uddhacca</em>).</p>
<p>The doubt arising regarding the Triple Gem (Buddha etc.), the results
of merit and demerit, rebirth after death, etc., is called
<em>Vicikicchā</em>. The unsettled nature, the agitated nature arising
in the mind when thinking or doing something is <em>Uddhacca</em>. The
Delusion-Rooted Consciousness arises sometimes associated with doubt and
sometimes associated with strong restlessness.</p>
<p>Because the Delusion-Rooted Consciousness is associated with delusion
which covers the nature of the object, because there is no certainty
about the object, and because it shakes due to restlessness, it is not
capable of taking the taste of the object well. Therefore, that
consciousness is always accompanied by Equanimity
(<em>Upekkhā</em>).</p>
<p>Doubt and restlessness are two things that arise in beings naturally.
They are not Dhammas arising from someone’s prompting. Therefore, the
distinction of prompting (<em>Saṅkhāra</em>) is not found in the
Delusion-Rooted Consciousness. All Delusion-Rooted Cittas are Unprompted
(<em>Asaṅkhārika</em>).</p>
<p>There are two Delusion-Rooted Cittas:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Consciousness accompanied by equanimity, associated with
doubt.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Consciousness accompanied by equanimity, associated with
restlessness.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Since Delusion-Rooted Cittas are weak, they do not produce grave
results like Greed-Rooted and Hatred-Rooted Cittas. The special evil in
the consciousness associated with doubt is that the mind of the person
in whom it arises does not incline towards merit but towards the five
sensual pleasures. Even if a merit is done with doubt, it is not a
strong merit.</p>
<p>Except for the supreme beings like the Buddhas who have superior
wisdom transcending the knowledge of ordinary humans, for others, doubt
increases by trying to criticize matters that are beyond their scope,
and by listening to and reading empty criticisms made by ordinary people
regarding the afterlife etc. The strategy to overcome it is to
understand the difference between oneself and the Buddhas etc., and to
develop faith.</p>
<p>The consciousness associated with restlessness arises sometimes in
sudden events, when doing many tasks at once, and when working quickly.
Since it is very weak, that consciousness does not have the power to
cause the being to reach hell after death. The remaining eleven
unwholesome Cittas have the power to cause rebirth in hell.</p>
<p>There are twelve Unwholesome Cittas: eight Greed-Rooted Cittas, two
Hatred-Rooted Cittas, and two Delusion-Rooted Cittas.</p>
<p>In those twelve Cittas, there are four joy-accompanied Cittas, six
equanimity-accompanied Cittas, two displeasure-accompanied Cittas, seven
unprompted Cittas, and five prompted Cittas.</p>

<li>The Eighteen Rootless Cittas - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-eighteen-rootless-cittas">10. The Eighteen Rootless
Cittas</h2>
<p>In this Dhamma, the name “Root” (<em>Hetu</em>) is used for the six
mental factors: Greed (<em>Lobha</em>), Hatred (<em>Dosa</em>), Delusion
(<em>Moha</em>), Non-Greed (<em>Alobha</em>), Non-Hatred
(<em>Adosa</em>), and Non-Delusion (<em>Amoha</em>). A consciousness
associated with at least one of the six Cetasikas called Roots is called
a Rooted (<em>Sahetuka</em>) Citta. Cittas that do not contain even one
root factor are called Rootless (<em>Ahetuka</em>) Cittas. There are
three parts of Rootless Cittas: Unwholesome Resultant, Wholesome
Resultant, and Functional. It should be especially remembered that the
name “Rootless” is used for these Cittas not because they arise
spontaneously without any cause, but because not even one of the six
Dhammas called Roots, such as greed etc., is present in those Cittas. (A
description of Roots will appear in a future chapter.) Since there are
seven Unwholesome Resultant Cittas, eight Wholesome Resultant Cittas,
and three Functional Cittas, there are (18) eighteen Rootless
Cittas.</p>
<p>Resultants (<em>Vipāka</em>) are Cittas arising in the future in the
continuity of the person who performed wholesome and unwholesome
actions, due to those wholesome and unwholesome actions. They are Cittas
caused to arise in the future by the power of wholesome and unwholesome
actions.</p>
<p><strong>The Seven Unwholesome Resultant Cittas</strong></p>
<p>Although the unwholesome result is generally one, there are seven
unwholesome resultant Cittas based on the places where the Cittas arise
and the functions performed by the Cittas.</p>
<p>There are six places where Cittas arise: Eye, Ear, Nose, Tongue,
Body, and Heart-base. (Details about them will be known later.) Among
resultant Cittas, there are Cittas arising in the eye. There are Cittas
arising in the ear, in the nose, in the tongue, and in the body. Those
Cittas are named according to the place of arising. Since the Cittas
arising in the Heart-base are many, they cannot be named according to
the place of origin. Among the Rootless Cittas, the Cittas arising in
the heart are named according to the function performed by each
Citta.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Eye-consciousness accompanied by equanimity</strong>
(<em>Upekkhā-sahagata Cakkhu-viññāṇa</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Ear-consciousness accompanied by equanimity</strong>
(<em>Upekkhā-sahagata Sota-viññāṇa</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Nose-consciousness accompanied by equanimity</strong>
(<em>Upekkhā-sahagata Ghāna-viññāṇa</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Tongue-consciousness accompanied by equanimity</strong>
(<em>Upekkhā-sahagata Jivhā-viññāṇa</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Body-consciousness accompanied by pain</strong>
(<em>Dukkha-sahagata Kāya-viññāṇa</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Receiving consciousness accompanied by equanimity</strong>
(<em>Upekkhā-sahagata Sampaṭicchana</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Investigating consciousness accompanied by
equanimity</strong> (<em>Upekkhā-sahagata Santīraṇa</em>)</li>
</ol>
<p>These seven are Unwholesome Resultant Cittas.</p>
<p>The meaning of <em>Cakkhu-viññāṇa</em> is ‘consciousness arising in
the eye’. By it, the seeing of the form that came before the eye is
performed.</p>
<p>The meaning of <em>Sota-viññāṇa</em> is ‘consciousness arising in the
ear’. By it, the hearing of sounds coming to the ear is done.</p>
<p>The meaning of <em>Ghāna-viññāṇa</em> is ‘consciousness arising in
the nose’. By it, the knowing of smells coming to the nose is
performed.</p>
<p>The meaning of <em>Kāya-viññāṇa</em> is ‘consciousness arising in the
body’. By it, the touches occurring in the body are known.</p>
<p>The consciousness that receives the object taken by the five
consciousnesses starting with eye-consciousness is called the
<em>Sampaṭicchana</em> (Receiving) Citta.</p>
<p>The consciousness that investigates the object taken by the Receiving
consciousness is named <em>Santīraṇa</em> (Investigating). (The nature
of Receiving and Investigating Cittas will be known in the Cognitive
Process section. For now, remember only the number of Cittas.)</p>
<p><strong>The Eight Rootless Wholesome Resultant Cittas</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Eye-consciousness accompanied by equanimity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ear-consciousness accompanied by equanimity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Nose-consciousness accompanied by equanimity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tongue-consciousness accompanied by equanimity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Body-consciousness accompanied by pleasure</strong>
(<em>Sukha-sahagata Kāya-viññāṇa</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Receiving consciousness accompanied by
equanimity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Investigating consciousness accompanied by joy</strong>
(<em>Somanassa-sahagata Santīraṇa</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Investigating consciousness accompanied by
equanimity</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus there are eight Rootless Wholesome Resultant Cittas.</p>
<p>Unwholesome Cittas produce only rootless results. Wholesome Cittas
produce both rootless and rooted (Sahetuka) results. What was mentioned
are the rootless resultant Cittas produced by wholesome kamma. The
rooted results produced by wholesome kamma will be known later.
<strong>It should also be remembered that there are Rootless Wholesome
Resultant Cittas, but no Rootless Wholesome Cittas.</strong></p>
<p>The difference in Rootless Wholesome Results compared to Unwholesome
Results is that Body-consciousness is accompanied by pleasure, and there
are two Investigating (Santīraṇa) Cittas.</p>
<p>There are two Investigating Cittas due to objects. When the object is
very good, the Investigating Citta is accompanied by joy. When the
object is moderate, it is accompanied by equanimity.</p>

<p>Cittas that do not have the nature of producing results and are not
results of any kamma are called Functional (<em>Kriya</em> or
<em>Kiriya</em>) Cittas. Performing some function is the nature of every
Citta. Since the names “Wholesome” and “Unwholesome” were given to
Cittas producing results, and the name “Resultant” was given to Cittas
produced by them, the name “Functional” is used for the remaining group
of Cittas based on the performance of respective functions. The names
for Rootless Functional Cittas are also given according to the functions
performed by those Cittas.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Five-door Adverting Consciousness accompanied by
equanimity</strong> (<em>Upekkhā-sahagata Pañcadvārāvajjana</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Mind-door Adverting Consciousness accompanied by
equanimity</strong> (<em>Upekkhā-sahagata Manodvārāvajjana</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Smile-producing Consciousness accompanied by joy</strong>
(<em>Somanassa-sahagata Hasituppāda</em>)</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the three Rootless Functional Cittas.</p>
<p>The places where Cittas arise—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body—are also
called “Doors” (<em>Dvāra</em>). Objects like forms enter the mental
continuum through those doors. The natural consciousness of the being,
called the <em>Bhavanga</em> Citta, and many other Cittas also arise in
the heart-base. The stream of Bhavanga Cittas existing in the heart-base
is called the Mind-door (<em>Manodvāra</em>). Various Cittas regarding
various matters keep rising from the Bhavanga Citta existing in the
heart-base.</p>
<p>If an object comes to any of the five doors such as the eye, that
object immediately appears at the Mind-door as well. Thereby, the
arising of Bhavanga Cittas stops, and a consciousness arises knowing
that some object has impinged on a door. Since it is an adverting
(turning towards) of the object that impinged on the five doors, that
Citta is called <em>Pañcadvārāvajjana</em> (Five-door Adverting).
Objects also come directly to the Mind-door without impinging on the
five doors. The consciousness that first arises regarding objects coming
in that way is called <strong>Mind-door Adverting</strong>
(<em>Manodvārāvajjana</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Five-door Adverting</strong> is the consciousness that
adverts to objects coming to the five doors. <strong>Mind-door
Adverting</strong> is the consciousness that first adverts to the object
coming to the Mind-door. (An understanding of these two Cittas can be
obtained when learning the Cognitive Process section. For now, just
remember the two Cittas generally.)</p>
<p><em>Hasituppāda Citta</em> is the consciousness producing smiles.
There are other Cittas that produce smiles. This Rootless Functional
Citta is one of them. Other Cittas that produce smiles perform not only
smiling but other things as well. This Citta performs only smiling.
Therefore, the name <em>Hasituppāda</em> has been given to it.</p>
<p>Apart from these three Rootless Functional Cittas, another (17)
seventeen Functional Cittas will be mentioned later. All Functional
Cittas are (20) twenty. Apart from the Five-door Adverting and Mind-door
Adverting Cittas, the remaining (18) eighteen Functional Cittas arise
only in Arahants. This Smile-producing Citta is also a Citta arising
only in Arahants. Arahants do not laugh aloud like ordinary people. It
is shown in poetics that laughter is of six kinds. <strong>Sita, Hasita,
Vihasita, Upahasita, Apahasita, Atihasita</strong> are the names of the
six kinds of laughter.</p>
<p>The laughter where only the two eyes open slightly, indicating to the
onlooker that one is joyful, is called <strong>Sita</strong>. The
laughter where the tips of the teeth are seen but no sound is made is
called <strong>Hasita</strong>. Supreme persons like Buddhas and Pacceka
Buddhas laugh in those two ways. They do not laugh making loud
sounds.</p>
<p>The laughter where a sweet sound arises is called
<strong>Vihasita</strong>. The laughter where the head and shoulders
shake is called <strong>Upahasita</strong>. Ordinary worldlings (Kalyāṇa
Puthujjana) and Trainees (Sekhas) laugh in those two ways. They do not
laugh making loud sounds.</p>
<p>The laughter where tears flow from the eyes is called
<strong>Apahasita</strong>. The laughter done shaking all body parts and
wriggling is called <strong>Atihasita</strong>. Those with base ideas
who have not developed virtues laugh in those two ways. The
Smile-producing Citta produces only <em>Sita</em> and
<em>Hasita</em>.</p>
<p>There are seven Unwholesome Resultant Cittas, eight Wholesome
Resultant Cittas, and three Functional Cittas, totaling eighteen
Rootless Cittas. Since Rootless Cittas are a weak group, a distinction
of prompting (<em>Saṅkhāra</em>) is not shown for them in the Abhidhamma
Pali. When counting Cittas, all eighteen Rootless Cittas are counted as
<strong>Unprompted</strong> (<em>Asaṅkhārika</em>) Cittas.</p>
<p>In the eighteen Rootless Cittas, there are two joy-accompanied
Cittas. There are (14) fourteen equanimity-accompanied Cittas. There is
one pleasure-accompanied Citta. There is one pain-accompanied Citta.</p>
<p>The (12) twelve Unwholesome Cittas and the (18) eighteen Rootless
Cittas, totaling thirty Cittas, are called
<strong>Non-Beautiful</strong> (<em>Asobhana</em>) Cittas. The Cittas
which are (59) fifty-nine by one method mentioned later, and (91)
ninety-one by another method, are called <strong>Beautiful</strong>
(<em>Sobhana</em>) Cittas.</p>

<li>The Eight Sense-Sphere Wholesome Cittas - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-eight-sense-sphere-wholesome-cittas">12. The Eight
Sense-Sphere Wholesome Cittas</h2>
<p>Cittas which, if arisen in someone’s continuity, produce desirable
results in that person’s continuity in the future, are called Wholesome
(<em>Kusala</em>) Cittas. The merit arising in ordinary people through
giving alms, observing virtue, etc., is Sense-Sphere Wholesome
(<em>Kāmāvacara Kusala</em>). That wholesome consciousness arises
accompanied by joy due to strong faith, receiving alms objects as
desired, receiving pleasant recipients, etc., and arises accompanied by
equanimity when those are not obtained. Therefore, the wholesome
consciousness, which is generally one, becomes two as Joy-Accompanied
Consciousness and Equanimity-Accompanied Consciousness. Sometimes that
merit arises accompanied by wisdom knowing kamma and result of kamma,
and sometimes without wisdom. Therefore, the Joy-Accompanied
Consciousness is divided into two as Consciousness Associated with
Knowledge (<em>Ñāṇa-sampayutta</em>) and Consciousness Dissociated from
Knowledge (<em>Ñāṇa-vippayutta</em>). By such division, there are four
Wholesome Cittas. Each of those four is again divided into two by the
distinction of prompting (<em>Saṅkhāra</em>). By such division, there
are eight Sense-Sphere Wholesome Cittas.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Joy-Accompanied Consciousness Associated with Knowledge,
Unprompted.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Joy-Accompanied Consciousness Associated with Knowledge,
Prompted.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Joy-Accompanied Consciousness Dissociated from Knowledge,

<li><strong>Joy-Accompanied Consciousness Dissociated from Knowledge,

<li><strong>Equanimity-Accompanied Consciousness Associated with

<li><strong>Equanimity-Accompanied Consciousness Dissociated from
Knowledge, Unprompted.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Equanimity-Accompanied Consciousness Dissociated from
Knowledge, Prompted.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These eight are the Sense-Sphere Wholesome Cittas.</p>
<p>This Sense-Sphere Wholesome is also called <strong>Great
Wholesome</strong> (<em>Mahā Kusala</em>). It is called so not because
it is superior like Fine-material, Immaterial, or Supramundane
Wholesome, but because it is the merit arising in many people living
everywhere in the world. Fine-material, Immaterial, and Supramundane
Wholesome arise only rarely in very few people.</p>
<p>The eight Sense-Sphere Wholesome Cittas arise through the performance
of the ten meritorious deeds: Giving (<em>Dāna</em>), Virtue
(<em>Sīla</em>), Meditation (<em>Bhāvanā</em>), Reverence
(<em>Apacāyana</em>), Service (<em>Veyyāvacca</em>), Transference of
Merit (<em>Pattidāna</em>), Rejoicing in Merit (<em>Pattānumodanā</em>),
Listening to Dhamma (<em>Dhammassavana</em>), Teaching Dhamma
(<em>Dhammadesanā</em>), and Straightening One’s Views
(<em>Diṭṭhijjukamma</em>).</p>
<p>Among the fifty-two Cetasikas, there is a certain Cetasika called
Volition (<em>Cetanā</em>). There are many varieties of Volition such as
volition of giving, volition of virtue, volition of meditation, volition
of killing, volition of stealing, volition of sexual misconduct, etc.
The mind is turned in various directions by Volition.</p>
<p>Each of the eight Great Wholesome Cittas becomes ten according to
volitions such as giving, etc., as Joy-Accompanied Consciousness
Associated with Knowledge Unprompted Giving-based Wholesome,
Joy-Accompanied Consciousness Associated with Knowledge Unprompted
Virtue-based Wholesome, etc. When all are added together, there are (80)
eighty Sense-Sphere Wholesome Cittas according to the ten meritorious
volitions.</p>
<p>A power existing in a Citta is the very Volition that turns thoughts
in various directions. The wholesome associated with sharp and great
volition is powerful. It has great results. The wholesome associated
with weak, small volition is weak; it has small results.</p>
<p>Someone gives a cent to a beggar with Joy-Accompanied Consciousness
Associated with Knowledge Unprompted. Another day, he gives a rupee to
that same beggar with that same consciousness. On both occasions, the
same Citta arises. However, the volition of giving the rupee is greater
than the volition of giving the cent. Therefore, it should be said that
the Joy-Accompanied Consciousness Associated with Knowledge Unprompted
arising on the day the rupee is given is powerful and produces great
results. In this way, the smallness or greatness of merits should be
considered everywhere according to volition.</p>
<p>The main factor for a merit to be superior or powerful is being
associated with knowledge. A merit dissociated from knowledge is not
superior to a merit associated with knowledge by factors such as being
accompanied by joy. Being accompanied by joy or equanimity, and being
unprompted or prompted are secondary factors regarding merit. Generally
speaking, it is said that joy-accompanied merit is superior to
equanimity-accompanied merit, and unprompted merit is superior to
prompted merit. A merit dissociated from knowledge is not superior to a
merit associated with knowledge in any respect.</p>
<p><strong>The Method of Arising of Sense-Sphere Wholesome
Cittas</strong></p>
<p>When doing giving etc. with joy, with wisdom knowing result of kamma,
and without anyone’s prompting, the <strong>Joy-Accompanied
Consciousness Associated with Knowledge, Unprompted</strong> arises.</p>
<p>When doing giving etc. with joy and wisdom, with prompting, the
<strong>Joy-Accompanied Consciousness Associated with Knowledge,
Prompted</strong> arises.</p>
<p>When doing giving etc. with joy only, without wisdom, and without
anyone’s prompting, the <strong>Joy-Accompanied Consciousness
Dissociated from Knowledge, Unprompted</strong> arises.</p>
<p>When doing giving etc. with joy, without wisdom, with prompting, the
<strong>Joy-Accompanied Consciousness Dissociated from Knowledge,
Prompted</strong> arises.</p>
<p>Consider how the four Equanimity-Accompanied Wholesome Cittas arise
when doing as stated above without joy, with neutrality.</p>

<p>There are eight Sense-Sphere Resultant Cittas with Roots.</p>
<p>These eight are not the only Cittas arising as results of
Sense-Sphere Wholesome. The eight Wholesome Resultant Cittas mentioned
above in Rootless Cittas are also results of this Sense-Sphere
Wholesome. The results of Sense-Sphere Wholesome are of two kinds:
Rootless and With Roots. These eight Cittas are Sense-Sphere Resultant
Cittas with Roots. The eight Wholesome Resultant Cittas mentioned in
Rootless Cittas are Rootless Wholesome Results.</p>
<p>After the person who performed Sense-Sphere Wholesome dies, these
Sense-Sphere Resultant Cittas with Roots arise as results of the
Sense-Sphere Wholesome in some existence, belonging to his mind
continuity that existed during the time he was alive. If the merit was a
very weak one, the Wholesome Resultant Equanimity-Accompanied
Investigating Citta arises first in the new existence as the result of
the weak merit. The arising of that first Citta somewhere after death is
itself the being’s arrival in that existence. After birth, Rootless
Wholesome Resultant Cittas such as Eye-consciousness etc. arise for him
as results of Sense-Sphere Wholesome, such as seeing good forms, hearing
good sounds, etc.</p>
<p><strong>The Eight Sense-Sphere Functional Cittas with
Roots</strong></p>
<p>Arahants, who have completely destroyed craving and will never be
born in Saṃsāra again, have no merit or demerit. However, Arahants also
perform good deeds conventionally accepted in the world as “merit,” such
as honoring those worthy of honor, preaching Dhamma, listening to
Dhamma, etc. The Cittas arising in Arahants by doing those things are
similar to Sense-Sphere Wholesome Cittas, but they do not have the power
to produce future results like the wholesome. Therefore, they are not
Wholesome. Since those Cittas arising in the continuity of Arahants have
only the mere performance of those actions, they are called “Functional
(<em>Kiriya</em>) Cittas.” Sense-Sphere Functional Cittas with Roots are
also eight, just like Sense-Sphere Wholesome.</p>

<li>The Fifteen Fine-Material-Sphere Cittas - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-fifteen-fine-material-sphere-cittas">14. The Fifteen
Fine-Material-Sphere Cittas</h2>
<p>The three classes of Cittas—Fine-material-sphere, Immaterial-sphere,
and Supramundane—are a special group of Cittas that do not arise in
ordinary people, but arise only in a few superior persons who have past
merit and great energy, and who have dispelled sensual desires. Only
Sense-Sphere Cittas arise in ordinary people. Of those, the
<strong>Smile-producing Citta</strong> and the <strong>Eight Great
Functional Cittas</strong> do not arise in them.</p>
<p>Fine-material-sphere Cittas etc. are called “Jhāna Cittas.” They are
very different from Sense-Sphere Cittas. They are superior. They are
powerful. Psychic powers (<em>Iddhi Pāṭihāriya</em>) can be performed by
the power of those Cittas.</p>
<p>Fine-material-sphere Consciousness is divided into three parts:
Wholesome, Resultant, and Functional. Each of those parts is again
divided into five based on Jhānas. Thus, there are fifteen
Fine-material-sphere Cittas.</p>
<p>Sense-Sphere Cittas have the power to take the object barely. The
power to take (know) the object well belongs to Jhāna Cittas. Jhāna
Cittas take the object such as the Kasiṇa very well and firmly, as if
embracing it. The Jhāna Citta can do so by the power of the Jhāna.</p>
<p>There are five Jhānas: First Jhāna, Second Jhāna, Third Jhāna, Fourth
Jhāna, and Fifth Jhāna. They are groups of mental factors (Cetasikas).
The main Jhāna factor is powerful One-pointedness (<em>Ekaggatā</em>).
There is also a weak one-pointedness in the mind of ordinary people. It
is not capable of keeping the mind on one object for a long time. Jhāna
One-pointedness is capable of keeping the mind on one object for a long
time. Jhāna attainers can keep their mind on the same object for hours,
even for the whole day.</p>
<p>There are five helping factors for One-pointedness or Concentration
(<em>Samādhi</em>): “<strong>Initial Application (Vitakka), Sustained
Application (Vicāra), Zest (Pīti), Happiness (Sukha), and Equanimity
(Upekkhā)</strong>.” Without allowing the concentrated mind to retreat
or shrink, <em>Vitakka</em> directs the meditator’s mind to the object
again and again. <em>Vicāra</em> strokes the object. <em>Pīti</em>
refreshes the mind. <em>Sukha</em> creates enjoyment. With the help of
the four factors starting with Vitakka, concentration becomes strong and
the First Jhāna is formed. The five factors—Vitakka, Vicāra, Pīti,
Sukha, Ekaggatā—existing in mutual connection are the First Jhāna.</p>
<p>When the person who obtained the First Jhāna continues to meditate
further, concentration develops to a state where it can be maintained
without Vitakka. Then the Second Jhāna arises in him consisting of four
factors: Vicāra, Pīti, Sukha, Ekaggatā. When the meditator meditates
again, concentration gradually develops, and the Third Jhāna consisting
of three factors—Pīti, Sukha, Ekaggatā—arises; the Fourth Jhāna
consisting of two factors—Sukha, Ekaggatā—arises; and the Fifth Jhāna
consisting of two factors—Upekkhā, Ekaggatā—arises. Cittas associated
with Jhāna are called ‘Jhāna Cittas’.</p>
<p><strong>The Five Fine-Material-Sphere Wholesome Cittas</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>First Jhāna Wholesome Consciousness together with Initial
Application, Sustained Application, Zest, Happiness, and
One-pointedness</strong></li>
<li><strong>Second Jhāna Wholesome Consciousness together with Sustained
Application, Zest, Happiness, and One-pointedness</strong></li>
<li><strong>Third Jhāna Wholesome Consciousness together with Zest,
Happiness, and One-pointedness</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fourth Jhāna Wholesome Consciousness together with Happiness
and One-pointedness</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fifth Jhāna Wholesome Consciousness together with Equanimity
and One-pointedness</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These are the five Fine-material-sphere Wholesome Cittas.</p>
<p><strong>Fine-Material-Sphere Resultant Cittas</strong></p>
<p>If a person who generated Fine-material-sphere Jhānas dies without
falling away from the Jhāna, he will be born in the Brahma world without
fail. Immediately after death, by the power of his Fine-material-sphere
Wholesome, a Fine-material-sphere Jhāna consciousness arises in the
Brahma world. That Citta arising there is the birth in the Brahma world.
For those who generated Fine-material-sphere Wholesome Jhānas, the Jhāna
Cittas arising in the Brahma world after death by the power of those
Wholesome Jhāna Cittas are Fine-material-sphere Resultant Cittas. Since
there is one resultant Citta for each Wholesome Jhāna Citta, there are
five Fine-material-sphere Resultant Cittas, such as <strong>First Jhāna
Resultant Consciousness together with Initial Application, Sustained
Application, Zest, Happiness, and One-pointedness</strong>, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Fine-Material-Sphere Functional Cittas</strong></p>
<p>To live in the bliss of Jhāna and to obtain the power of performing
psychic powers, Arahants also sometimes generate Jhānas. The
Fine-material-sphere Jhāna Cittas thus generated by Arahants are
Fine-material-sphere Functional, as they do not have the power to
produce future results. Fine-material-sphere Functional Cittas are also
five, like the Wholesome, such as <strong>First Jhāna Functional
Consciousness together with Initial Application, Sustained Application,
Zest, Happiness, and One-pointedness</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>“Five Wholesome Cittas, five Resultant Cittas, and five Functional
Cittas make fifteen Fine-material-sphere Cittas.</p>
<p>In these Jhāna Cittas, the word <em>Sukha</em> refers to
<em>Somanassa</em> (Joy) itself. <em>Upekkhā</em> refers to Equanimity
Feeling. In these Cittas, the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Jhāna
Cittas are Joy-Accompanied Cittas. In the fifteen Fine-material-sphere
Cittas, there are three of each First Jhāna etc. There are twelve
Joy-Accompanied Cittas. There are three Equanimity-Accompanied
Cittas.</p>
<p>There is no special benefit in learning Abhidhamma by investigating
the unprompted/prompted nature of Fine-material-sphere,
Immaterial-sphere, and Supramundane Cittas. For ease of counting Cittas
in classification, they are counted as Prompted Cittas.</p>

<li>The Twelve Immaterial-Sphere Cittas - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-twelve-immaterial-sphere-cittas">15. The Twelve
Immaterial-Sphere Cittas</h2>
<p>The Fifth Jhāna Citta, which has been separated from material forms
(Rūpa) and made more peaceful and superior, is called
“<strong>Immaterial-sphere (Arūpāvacara) Consciousness</strong>.” Like
the Fine-material-sphere Consciousness, it is also divided into three:
Wholesome, Resultant, and Functional.</p>
<p><strong>The Four Immaterial-Sphere Wholesome Cittas</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Wholesome Consciousness of the Base of Infinite Space
(Ākāsānañcāyatana Kusala Citta)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wholesome Consciousness of the Base of Infinite
Consciousness (Viññāṇañcāyatana Kusala Citta)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wholesome Consciousness of the Base of Nothingness
(Ākiñcaññāyatana Kusala Citta)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wholesome Consciousness of the Base of
Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception (Nevasaññānāsaññāyatana Kusala
Citta)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, there are four Immaterial-sphere Wholesome Cittas based on
object distinction. This Immaterial-sphere Consciousness is a single
Citta that becomes divided by way of objects. Immaterial-sphere Cittas
can only be generated by those who have generated the
Fine-material-sphere Fifth Jhāna. Some who have obtained the
Fine-material-sphere Fifth Jhāna, seeing the trouble of maintaining a
material body, seeing that much suffering arises for beings because of
the material body, becoming disenchanted with the material body,
generate Immaterial Jhānas with the hope of obtaining an immaterial
existence.</p>
<p>Immaterial Jhānas are generated as follows: The attainer of the
Fine-material-sphere Fifth Jhāna remains for a short while with the
Fifth Jhāna consciousness taking a Kasiṇa other than the Space Kasiṇa as
object. Then, with the hope of removing his Jhāna consciousness from the
material sign (Rūpa Nimitta), he looks at the Kasiṇa sign which was the
object of the Jhāna consciousness mentally, and instead of thinking of
it as a material form, starts thinking or meditating on it as “Space.”
When meditating thus, the material Kasiṇa sign disappears, and space
appears in the place where the Kasiṇa sign appeared earlier. Since it is
taken from the Kasiṇa, that appearing space is called “<strong>Space
obtained by the removal of the Kasiṇa</strong>”
(<em>Kasiṇugghāṭimākāsa</em>). When continuing to meditate “Space,
Space,” the Fine-material-sphere Fifth Jhāna, which previously existed
on a material sign, arises again taking that space as object. Generating
it thus is the removal of the Fine-material-sphere Fifth Jhāna from the
material sign. That Fifth Jhāna Citta removed from the material sign is
the first Immaterial-sphere Citta.</p>
<p>The space that is the object of that Citta is something felt only by
the meditator’s mind as existing, not something that truly exists. It is
a Concept (<em>Paññatti</em>). That space, which does not exist in
truth, has no beginning end of first arising. It has no final end of
perishing. Therefore, it is called Infinite Space (<em>Anantākāsa</em>).
Since it is associated with the Jhāna taking Infinite Space as object,
the first Immaterial-sphere Wholesome Citta is given the name
“<strong>Wholesome Consciousness of the Base of Infinite Space</strong>”
(<em>Ākāsānañcāyatana Kusala Citta</em>).</p>
<p><strong>The meaning of Wholesome Consciousness of the Base of
Infinite Space is the wholesome consciousness existing taking infinite
space as object.</strong></p>
<p>The meditator who obtained the Ākāsānañcāyatana Jhāna, in order to
further distance his Jhāna from the material sign, abandons the space
that is the object of the first Immaterial Citta, takes only that Citta,
and starts meditating “Consciousness, Consciousness” making it the
object. When doing so, the Wholesome Consciousness of the Base of
Infinite Consciousness (<em>Viññāṇañcāyatana Kusala Citta</em>) arises
to him taking the first Immaterial Citta as object.</p>
<p><strong>The meaning of Wholesome Consciousness of the Base of
Infinite Consciousness is the consciousness associated with Jhāna
existing taking consciousness (the first arūpa citta) as
object.</strong></p>
<p>Even for those who have obtained Jhānas, the Jhāna consciousness does
not exist constantly. In occasions where they dwell with other Cittas,
the Jhāna consciousness is not there. The meditator who obtained the
second Immaterial Jhāna meditates “There is nothing, there is nothing”
(<em>Natthi kiñci, natthi kiñci</em>) reflecting on the absence of the
first Immaterial Jhāna Citta to obtain the third Immaterial Jhāna. When
doing so, the third Immaterial Jhāna Citta, the Wholesome Consciousness
of the Base of Nothingness (<em>Ākiñcaññāyatana Kusala Citta</em>),
arises taking the absence of the first Immaterial-sphere Citta as
object.</p>
<p><strong>The meaning of Wholesome Consciousness of the Base of
Nothingness is the consciousness associated with Jhāna taking the
absence of the first Immaterial-sphere Citta as object.</strong></p>
<p>The meditator who obtained the third Immaterial Jhāna, in order to
obtain the fourth Immaterial Jhāna, takes the third Immaterial Jhāna
Citta he has obtained and starts meditating “This is peaceful, this is
excellent.” From that meditation, taking the third Immaterial Jhāna
Citta as object, the fourth Immaterial Jhāna Citta arises. It is the
Citta placed at the peak of subtlety. There is no other Citta more
subtle than it. Its subtlety is such that it is difficult even for the
meditator dwelling with that Citta to know “did I dwell with a mind, or
did I dwell without a mind.” Since it is very subtle, that fourth
Immaterial Jhāna Citta is called “<strong>Wholesome Consciousness of the
Base of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception</strong>”
(<em>Nevasaññānāsaññāyatana Kusala Citta</em>).</p>
<p>The meaning of Wholesome Consciousness of the Base of
Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception is the wholesome consciousness so
subtle that it is as if there is perception and as if there is no
perception.</p>

Immaterial-Sphere Resultant and Functional Cittas</h2>
<p>The person who has obtained Immaterial Jhānas will be born in the
Immaterial World after death by the power of that wholesome kamma. Jhāna
Cittas identical to the Immaterial Wholesome arise for birth in the
Immaterial existence and for the uninterrupted continuation of that
Immaterial existence. They are Immaterial-sphere Resultants.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Resultant Consciousness of the Base of Infinite Space</li>
<li>Resultant Consciousness of the Base of Infinite Consciousness</li>
<li>Resultant Consciousness of the Base of Nothingness</li>
<li>Resultant Consciousness of the Base of
Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus there are also four Immaterial-sphere Resultant Cittas.</p>
<p>In the Sense and Fine-material worlds, the consciousness of beings
exists associated with a material body (<em>Rūpa-kāya</em>). They do not
have the power to exist without a material body. Immaterial-sphere
Resultants are developed to be able to exist without matter. Therefore,
no material body arises with the Immaterial Rebirth Consciousness. They
live for a very long time with consciousness. Sense-sphere beings have
to suffer endless suffering due to maintaining a material body. The
Immaterial being does not have even one of those sufferings. Immaterial
beings have a happiness very similar to the happiness of Nibbāna.
Sense-sphere beings have happiness obtained by gratifying the senses
with external things. Nothing external is needed for the happiness of
Immaterial beings. The existence of Sense-sphere beings is like rice. If
other things are not added, it has no taste. The Immaterial existence is
like a piece of cake. Nothing else needs to be added to make it tasty.
That life itself of the Immaterial being is a happiness for him.</p>
<p>There is an attainment called the Attainment of Cessation
(<em>Nirodha Samāpatti</em>) belonging only to Non-Returners
(<em>Anāgāmi</em>) and Arahants. It is living without consciousness. It
can be entered by Non-Returners and Arahants who have obtained all
Fine-material and Immaterial Jhānas. Arahants also generate Immaterial
Jhānas to be able to enter the Attainment of Cessation. The Immaterial
Jhāna Cittas without result-producing power generated by Arahants are
Immaterial-sphere Functional Cittas. There are also four
Immaterial-sphere Functional Cittas, such as Functional Consciousness of
the Base of Infinite Space, etc.</p>
<p>Four Wholesome Cittas, four Resultant Cittas, and four Functional
Cittas make twelve Immaterial-sphere Cittas. All of them are Fifth Jhāna
Cittas. By division of feeling, they are Equanimity-Accompanied Cittas.
Although Immaterial-sphere Cittas are similar to each other by being
Fifth Jhānas, the higher Immaterial Jhāna Cittas are more superior and
refined than the lower Immaterial Jhāna Cittas.</p>
<p>Since they are a group of Cittas not belonging to ordinary people,
belonging only to superior people, generated and maintained only by
superior persons, the name <strong>Sublime Cittas (Mahaggata
Citta)</strong> is also used for Fine-material-sphere and
Immaterial-sphere Cittas. There are (27) twenty-seven Sublime
Cittas.</p>
<p>In Sublime Cittas, there are nine Wholesome, nine Resultant, and nine
Functional. There are three First Jhāna Cittas. There are three each of
Second Jhāna, Third Jhāna, and Fourth Jhāna Cittas. There are fifteen
Fifth Jhāna Cittas. In the Sublime, there are twelve Joy-Accompanied
Cittas. There are fifteen Equanimity-Accompanied Cittas.</p>
<p>The (54) fifty-four Sense-sphere Cittas, (15) fifteen
Fine-material-sphere Cittas, and (12) twelve Immaterial-sphere Cittas
constitute the (81) eighty-one “<strong>Mundane (Lokiya)
Cittas</strong>.” There are (17) seventeen Mundane Wholesome Cittas.
There are (32) thirty-two Mundane Resultant Cittas. There are (20)
twenty Functional Cittas.</p>
<p>In the eighty-one Mundane Cittas, there are (31) thirty-one
Joy-Accompanied Cittas. There are (47) forty-seven
Equanimity-Accompanied Cittas. There are (3) three

<li>The Eight Supramundane Cittas - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-eight-supramundane-cittas">17. The Eight Supramundane
Cittas</h2>
<p>The eight mental factors: Right View (<em>Sammā Diṭṭhi</em>), Right
Intention (<em>Sammā Saṅkappa</em>), Right Speech (<em>Sammā Vācā</em>),
Right Action (<em>Sammā Kammanta</em>), Right Livelihood (<em>Sammā
Ājīva</em>), Right Effort (<em>Sammā Vāyāma</em>), Right Mindfulness
(<em>Sammā Sati</em>), and Right Concentration (<em>Sammā Samādhi</em>)
are called the ‘Noble Eightfold Path’. These factors gradually develop
in the mind of the meditator engaged in Insight Meditation
(<em>Vipassanā</em>) desiring to cross over from the world called
Saṃsāra. The consciousness associated with the Supramundane Path, which
has developed to the extent that it can realize Nibbāna for the
meditator and destroy defilements so they never arise again, crossing
the being over the world and leading to Nibbāna, is called
“<strong>Supramundane Path</strong>.” The consciousness associated with
that Supramundane Path is called ‘<strong>Supramundane
Consciousness</strong>’.</p>
<p>In the continuity of one person, the Supramundane Path arises four
times, each time stronger than the last. The Supramundane Path arising
the first time is named ‘Stream-Entry Path’ (<em>Sotāpatti Magga</em>);
the Supramundane Path arising the second time is named ‘Once-Returning
Path’ (<em>Sakadāgāmi Magga</em>); the Supramundane Path arising the
third time is named ‘Non-Returning Path’ (<em>Anāgāmi Magga</em>); and
the Supramundane Path arising the fourth time is named ‘Arahant Path’
(<em>Arahatta Magga</em>). According to the Supramundane Paths arising
in four times, there are four Supramundane Wholesome Cittas:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Stream-Entry Path Consciousness</strong></li>
<li><strong>Once-Returning Path Consciousness</strong></li>
<li><strong>Non-Returning Path Consciousness</strong></li>
<li><strong>Arahant Path Consciousness</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>For Supramundane results, the name “<strong>Fruit</strong>”
(<em>Phala</em>) is mostly used instead of “Resultant”
(<em>Vipāka</em>). There is no difference in meaning between the words
Vipāka and Phala. The Supramundane Wholesome is not a wholesome that
produces its result after a delay like mundane wholesome, but a
wholesome that produces the result immediately.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Stream-Entry Fruit Consciousness</strong></li>
<li><strong>Once-Returning Fruit Consciousness</strong></li>
<li><strong>Non-Returning Fruit Consciousness</strong></li>
<li><strong>Arahant Fruit Consciousness</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus there are also four Supramundane Resultant Cittas. There are no
Supramundane Functional Cittas. Being four Wholesome Cittas and four
Resultant Cittas, there are eight Supramundane Cittas. There are no
Supramundane Functional Cittas because each Path Consciousness arises
only once in one person. Upon the first arising of the Path
Consciousness, the destruction of defilements occurs according to the
strength of that respective Path Consciousness. Path Cittas do not arise
again and again because there is nothing more to destroy in the
destroyed defilements.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="the-method-of-expanding-supramundane-cittas">18. The Method of
Expanding Supramundane Cittas</h2>
<p>It was stated above that there are five Jhānas such as First Jhāna
etc. Those Jhānas exist not only in Fine-material-sphere Cittas but also
in Supramundane Cittas. Therefore, the name “Jhāna Cittas” applies to
Supramundane Cittas. Supramundane Cittas arising in those who have not
obtained Jhānas always arise associated with the First Jhāna. For those
who have obtained Jhānas, Supramundane Cittas can be associated with the
five Jhānas starting with the First. Therefore, the Stream-Entry Path
Consciousness shown as one in the brief method becomes five Cittas by
Jhāna division:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First Jhāna Stream-Entry Path Consciousness</li>
<li>Second Jhāna Stream-Entry Path Consciousness</li>
<li>Third Jhāna Stream-Entry Path Consciousness</li>
<li>Fourth Jhāna Stream-Entry Path Consciousness</li>
<li>Fifth Jhāna Stream-Entry Path Consciousness</li>
</ol>
<p>The Once-Returning, Non-Returning, and Arahant Path Cittas also
become five each in the same way. Thus, since each Supramundane
Wholesome Citta becomes five by Jhāna division, there are (20) twenty
Supramundane Wholesome Cittas. Since the four Fruit Cittas also become
differentiated by Jhāna in the same way, there are (20) twenty
Supramundane Resultant Cittas. Being twenty Wholesome Cittas and twenty
Resultant Cittas, there are (40) forty Supramundane Cittas by the
detailed method.</p>
<p>In these forty Supramundane Cittas, there are eight First Jhāna
Cittas. There are eight each of Second Jhāna etc. Cittas. Since First,
Second, Third, and Fourth Jhāna Cittas are Joy-Accompanied, there are
thirty-two Supramundane Joy-Accompanied Cittas. Since Fifth Jhāna Cittas
are Equanimity-Accompanied, there are eight Supramundane
Equanimity-Accompanied Cittas.</p>
<p>The (27) twenty-seven Sublime Cittas and (40) forty Supramundane
Cittas make (67) sixty-seven Jhāna Cittas. Among them, there are (11)
eleven First Jhāna Cittas. There are eleven each of Second, Third, and
Fourth Jhāna Cittas. There are (23) twenty-three Fifth Jhāna Cittas.
Find the Cittas belonging to those respective Jhānas.</p>
<p>When counting all Cittas, the Supramundane Cittas shown by brief and
detailed methods should be counted by one method. By the brief method,
there are (89) eighty-nine Cittas. By the detailed method, there are
(121) one hundred and twenty-one. In many places ahead, facts will be
stated according to the detailed method of Cittas. Therefore, one should
master the classification of consciousness by that method.</p>
<p>Fifty-four Sense-Sphere Cittas, fifteen Fine-material-sphere Cittas,
twelve Immaterial-sphere Cittas, and forty Supramundane Cittas make
(121) one hundred and twenty-one Cittas by plane division.</p>
<p>Twelve Unwholesome, thirty Wholesome, fifty-two Resultant, and twenty
Functional make one hundred and twenty-one Cittas by kind division.</p>
<p>Sixty-three Joy-Accompanied Cittas, fifty-five Equanimity-Accompanied
Cittas, and three Displeasure-Accompanied Cittas make one hundred and
twenty-one Cittas by feeling division. Find the Cittas belonging to all
these parts. If dividing Cittas by prompting (<em>Saṅkhāra</em>)

<li>The 52 Mental Factors (Cetasikas) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-52-mental-factors-cetasikas">1. The 52 Mental Factors
(Cetasikas)</h2>
<p>Phenomena that are associated with consciousness (citta) in four
ways—arising together with consciousness without even a slight delay or
precedence, ceasing together with it, taking the very object taken by
the consciousness, and arising in the very base where the consciousness
arises—are Cetasikas.</p>
<p><strong>Being Associated (Sampayoga)</strong> means mixing in such a
way that they cannot be separated in any manner. The four facts such as
arising together are called “the four characteristics of
association.”</p>
<p>There are fifty-two Cetasikas. Not all of them arise together with a
single Citta at once. Only the Cetasikas required to perform the
function belonging to that Citta arise with each single Citta. There are
also Cetasikas that are opposed to each other like light and darkness.
Mutually opposed Cetasikas never arise together. Therefore, all
fifty-two Cetasikas cannot arise together bound with one Citta.</p>
<p>The maximum number of Cetasikas arising together with one Citta at
one time is thirty-six. Groups of Cetasikas numbering seven, ten,
eleven, twelve, etc., arise with those respective Cittas.</p>
<p>A Citta cannot arise without the assistance of Cetasikas. A Cetasika
also cannot arise without the assistance of Citta. Therefore, the Citta
and the group of Cetasikas required to perform the function performed by
that Citta must arise all at once, without precedence or delay. It is
for this reason that arising together with Citta was stated as a
characteristic of Cetasikas.</p>
<p>Just as the heartwood of a log remains while the sapwood decays and
disappears first, some phenomena belonging to one group of Citta and
Cetasikas do not disappear while others remain. If one ceases, others
cannot exist without ceasing along with it. Therefore, ceasing together
with Citta was also stated as a characteristic of Cetasikas.</p>
<p>Taking the object is the function belonging to Citta. The only work
done by Citta is taking the object. Experiencing the taste of the
object, attaching to the object, opposing it, etc., are functions
belonging to Cetasikas. What the Cetasikas arising with a Citta taking a
certain object do is experience the taste of the object taken by that
Citta, attach to that object, oppose that object, etc. Therefore, taking
the very object taken by the Citta was stated as a characteristic of
Cetasikas.</p>
<p>There are six places where Cittas arise. If Citta arises in a certain
place, the Cetasikas arising with that Citta also arise in that very
place, associating with that very base. Therefore, arising in the very
place where Citta arises was stated as a characteristic of
Cetasikas.</p>
<p>There are three groups of Cetasikas: Ethically Variable
(<em>Aññasamāna</em>) Group, Unwholesome (<em>Akusala</em>) Group, and
Beautiful (<em>Sobhana</em>) Group. There are thirteen Cetasikas
belonging to the Ethically Variable Group: seven Universal Cetasikas and
six Occasional Cetasikas. There are fourteen Cetasikas belonging to the
Unwholesome Group. The nineteen Beautiful Universal Cetasikas, the three
Abstinences (<em>Virati</em>), the two Illimitables
(<em>Appamaññā</em>), and the Wisdom (<em>Paññā</em>) Cetasika—these
twenty-five Cetasikas belong to the Beautiful Group.</p>

<li>The Seven Universal Mental Factors - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-seven-universal-mental-factors">2. The Seven Universal
Mental Factors</h2>
<p>There are seven Universal Mental Factors: <strong>Contact (Phassa),
Feeling (Vedanā), Perception (Saññā), Volition (Cetanā), One-pointedness
(Ekaggatā), Life Faculty (Jīvitindriya), and Attention
(Manasikāra)</strong>.</p>
<p>These seven Cetasikas are required for the arising of every Citta.
Since they are associated with all Cittas without distinction as
wholesome, unwholesome, etc., these seven Cetasikas are called
“<strong>Universals</strong>” (<em>Sabbacittasādhāraṇa</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Contact (Phassa)</strong></p>
<p>Contact is the nature of touching the object. Touching means coming
close so that there is no gap. It is also called grazing/contacting.
Someone groping in the dark can only know what touches the hand.
Similarly, the mind feels only what touches the mind. Therefore, for a
mind or knowing to arise, there must be contact with what is to be
known. Know that this “<strong>Contact Cetasika</strong>” is a necessary
factor for all Cittas because there cannot be knowing without contact.
This Phassa regarding the mind is not a touching like two objects
touching together, but a certain subtle nature known by the name of
touching. It is a Cetasika difficult to understand.</p>
<p><strong>Feeling (Vedanā)</strong></p>
<p>Feeling is the nature of experiencing the taste of the object,
whether it is goodness, badness, or neutrality. In the Citta Chapter,
what was mentioned by the names <em>Somanassa</em>, <em>Domanassa</em>,
<em>Upekkhā</em>, <em>Sukha</em>, and <em>Dukkha</em> was this Feeling
Cetasika.</p>
<p><strong>Perception (Saññā)</strong></p>
<p>Perception is the nature of taking the mode/sign of the object. Every
object has a special mode helpful for distinguishing it from other
things and recognizing it. When a Citta arises as taking an object, the
Perception Cetasika taking the mode of the object also always arises
with that Citta. That Perception is a recognizing of that respective
thing according to previously arisen perception, and also a marking for
future recognition. Since taking the mode of the object is also
recognizing, in many books it is said that “Perception is the nature
that recognizes objects.”</p>
<p><strong>Volition (Cetanā)</strong></p>
<p>Volition is the effort to perform actions such as looking, hearing,
eating, drinking, going, coming, giving, taking, etc. There are
immeasurable actions performed by beings. The effort to perform every
single one of those actions is the Volition Cetasika. There are
immeasurable volitions such as volition of killing, volition of
stealing, volition of giving, etc. All of them are considered as the
Volition Cetasika by virtue of being volition.</p>
<p>When the effort to perform a certain action arises, a consciousness
complying with it also arises. A group of Cetasikas required to perform
that action also arises bound with it, following the Volition. Volition
is the chief of all of them. Therefore, it is said that “Volition is
like a general.” Every Citta arises as the performance of some action.
Therefore, there is a Volition in every Citta. In performing actions,
Volition is chief. In taking the object, Citta is chief. It is to this
Volition Cetasika that “Kamma” is said.</p>
<p><strong>One-pointedness (Ekaggatā)</strong></p>
<p>One-pointedness is the nature that firmly places the mind on the
object so it does not shake. Even in a single object, there are various
modes in which that object can be taken by the mind, considered by the
mind. When looking at an object from one place, that object appears in
one way. If looking from another place, the same object appears in
another way. Thus, if looking from a hundred places, the same object
appears in a hundred ways. All those appearing modes are modes in which
that object can be taken by the mind.</p>
<p>When taking one thing by the mind, that object must be taken by one
of those many modes existing in the object. One Citta cannot take one
object in several modes at once. For the Citta to be able to take the
object, it must be established in one mode existing in the object. What
is done by One-pointedness is the establishing in some one mode of the
object. Because of that establishing, the Citta becomes able to take the
object in one mode. Since there are manifold modes in objects, a Citta
cannot take an object without One-pointedness. Therefore,
One-pointedness is needed for every Citta.
“<strong>Concentration</strong>” (<em>Samādhi</em>) is another name for
the One-pointedness Cetasika. Mostly that name is used for developed
One-pointedness.</p>
<p><strong>Life Faculty (Jīvitindriya)</strong></p>
<p>The life force, the power of living of Citta and Cetasikas, is called
“<strong>Life Faculty</strong>.” The body exists without collapsing for
a long time through the support of food and drink. There is nothing
taken from outside that helps the existence of the mind. However, there
must be something that helps the existence of the mental continuum.
Without such a thing, this mental continuum cannot exist uninterruptedly
until the attainment of Nibbāna. The thing that helps the existence of
the being’s mental continuum until the attainment of Nibbāna, that
governs it, is this Life Faculty Cetasika. Because of the governance
done by it, the mental continuum exists uninterrupted even by death
until Parinibbāna.</p>
<p><strong>Attention (Manasikāra)</strong></p>
<p>Attention is the Dhamma that engages the mind in taking the object
again and again without allowing the mind to depart from the object. It
is said that the mental continuum, which breaks and departs from the
object every moment starting from rebirth, engages in taking objects
arising again and again because of this Cetasika. This is an obscure
Cetasika difficult to understand.</p>

<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The Six Occasional Mental Factors - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-six-occasional-mental-factors">3. The Six Occasional Mental
Factors</h2>
<p>There are six Occasional (<em>Pakiṇṇaka</em>) Cetasikas:
<strong>Initial Application (Vitakka), Sustained Application (Vicāra),
Decision (Adhimokkha), Energy (Viriya), Zest (Pīti), and Desire
(Chanda)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Initial Application (Vitakka)</strong></p>
<p>Vitakka is the nature of going towards the object, mounting onto the
object. When Vitakka arrives at the object, the Citta and Cetasikas
arising with it also arrive at the object following it. Therefore,
Vitakka is also called the Dhamma that leads Citta and Cetasikas to the
object. Weak Vitakka is unapparent. It becomes apparent when one
intentionally generates Vitakka. Thinking is what is called doing so.
The effort made to arrive at places where the mind has not arrived, to
know what is not known, is called “thinking.”</p>
<p><strong>Sustained Application (Vicāra)</strong></p>
<p>Vicāra is the nature of stroking the object arrived at by Vitakka.
The stroking intended here is the nature of rubbing against the object,
spreading over the object. The mind that arrived at the object by the
power of Vitakka spreads over it by the power of Vicāra. It acts as if
pressing down and looking. Of Vitakka and Vicāra, Vitakka is gross.
Vicāra is subtle. It is unapparent. It is said that gross Vitakka should
be known like the first striking of a bell, and subtle Vicāra like the
subtle sound reverberating after the initial striking of the bell. From
this simile, it might seem that Vicāra arises after Vitakka. Although
this simile is given to show the nature of the two Cetasikas, they
should be understood as two Dhammas arising in a single moment without
priority or posteriority.</p>
<p><strong>Decision (Adhimokkha)</strong></p>
<p>Adhimokkha is the nature of deciding the mode of the object. Because
of this Cetasika, the mind is able to take the object in some specific
way, whether correctly or incorrectly, without going into two or three
directions like “is it this or is it that?”. If this Cetasika is absent,
the mind is unable to grasp the object properly. This is also an obscure
Cetasika difficult to understand.</p>
<p><strong>Energy (Viriya)</strong></p>
<p>Viriya is the nature of not retreating in the task, the nature of
proceeding until the started thing is accomplished. There are two kinds
of Viriya: Bodily Viriya and Mental Viriya. Here, Mental Viriya is
intended. Bodily strength is called Bodily Viriya. It is not a Cetasika
Dhamma.</p>
<p><strong>Zest (Pīti)</strong></p>
<p>Pīti is the nature of the mind being pleased—the nature of blooming
like a flower, inflating. This is a very apparent nature.</p>
<p><strong>Desire (Chanda)</strong></p>
<p>The wish to do various things, the want to do, is Chanda. This is a
Cetasika that appears somewhat similar to Greed (Lobha). However, Chanda
does not have the nature of sticking/attaching like Lobha. Chanda is a
want free from attachment. There are manifold Chandas. The Chanda
arising in Greed-associated Cittas is conducive to Greed. The Chanda
arising in Cittas opposed to Greed is opposed to Greed.</p>
<p>Unlike the Universal Cetasikas which apply to every Citta, since
these six Cetasikas apply scattered appropriately in Cittas belonging to
all sides such as Wholesome, Unwholesome, Mundane, Supramundane, etc.,
they are called <strong>Occasionals</strong> (<em>Pakiṇṇaka</em>).</p>
<p>Since these thirteen Cetasikas—the seven Universal Cetasikas and the
six Occasional Cetasikas—apply with Cetasikas belonging to the two
groups: Unwholesome Group and Beautiful Group, they are called
<strong>Ethically Variable</strong> (<em>Aññasamāna</em>).</p>

<li>The Fourteen Unwholesome Mental Factors - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-fourteen-unwholesome-mental-factors">4. The Fourteen
Unwholesome Mental Factors</h2>
<p>There are fourteen Unwholesome Cetasikas: <strong>Delusion (Moha),
Shamelessness (Ahirika), Fearlessness of Wrongdoing (Anottappa),
Restlessness (Uddhacca), Greed (Lobha), Wrong View (Diṭṭhi), Conceit
(Māna), Hatred (Dosa), Envy (Issā), Avarice (Macchariya), Worry
(Kukkucca), Sloth (Thīna), Torpor (Middha), and Doubt
(Vicikicchā)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Delusion (Moha)</strong></p>
<p>Moha is the nature that covers the true state of the object. Moha
should be said to be like a film over the eye, and like darkness.
Because of this, suffering appears to beings as sweetness, as happiness.
Craving, the cause of suffering, appears as a cause of happiness. The
true happiness which is the cessation of suffering appears as evil. The
true path to obtaining happiness appears as suffering. Therefore, not
knowing suffering, not knowing the cause of suffering, not knowing the
true happiness which is the cessation of suffering, and not knowing the
path leading to true happiness are called Moha. Ignorance
(<em>Avijjā</em>) also refers to this Moha.</p>
<p><strong>Shamelessness (Ahirika)</strong></p>
<p>Ahirika is the nature of not being disgusted by sin. It is also
called the nature of not being ashamed of sin.</p>
<p><strong>Fearlessness of Wrongdoing (Anottappa)</strong></p>
<p>Anottappa is the nature of not fearing sin. These two Cetasikas,
Ahirika and Anottappa, are two great powers in the unwholesome side.</p>
<p><strong>Restlessness (Uddhacca)</strong></p>
<p>Uddhacca is the nature of the mind shaking, the nature of not staying
well on the object. This is a nature opposed to concentration.</p>
<p><strong>Greed (Lobha)</strong></p>
<p>Lobha is the nature of taking the object as a good thing and sticking
to it. It should also be called the nature of attaching to the object.
Lust, affection, love, fondness, desire, want—these words also refer to
Lobha itself.</p>
<p><strong>Wrong View (Diṭṭhi)</strong></p>
<p>Diṭṭhi is the nature of seeing wrongly, the nature of taking a matter
incorrectly. Taking what exists as not existing, what does not exist as
existing, what happened as not happened, what will happen as not
happening, a good thing as a bad thing, a bad thing as a good thing, a
thing with good results as a thing with bad results, and a thing with
bad results as a thing with good results is the nature of seeing
wrongly. Diṭṭhi is of two kinds: Right View (<em>Sammā Diṭṭhi</em>) and
Wrong View (<em>Micchā Diṭṭhi</em>). Sammā Diṭṭhi is the wisdom seeing
the matter as it is. Micchā Diṭṭhi is the nature of seeing wrongly. In
these unwholesome Cetasikas, the name Diṭṭhi refers to Micchā
Diṭṭhi.</p>
<p><strong>Conceit (Māna)</strong></p>
<p>Māna is the nature of measuring one’s own status by oneself, thinking
“I am a certain high person in the world,” etc. Māna is threefold: Seyya
Māna (Superiority Conceit), Sadisa Māna (Equality Conceit), and Hīna
Māna (Inferiority Conceit). The conceit arising as “I am superior to
others” is Seyya Māna. The conceit arising as “I am equal to others” is
Sadisa Māna. The conceit arising as “I am inferior to others” is Hīna
Māna. It is said that this conceit should be known like madness.</p>
<p><strong>Hatred (Dosa)</strong></p>
<p>Dosa is the nature opposed to the object. Dvesha is also a name for
it. It generally has the characteristic of harshness and roughness. It
arises in several ways. Anger, wrath, fear, dissatisfaction, disgust,
displeasure—these names refer to Dosa arising in those respective ways.
Grief is also something arising with Dosa.</p>
<p><strong>Envy (Issā)</strong></p>
<p>Issā is the nature opposed to the happiness of others, the prosperity
of others. Jealousy is also a name for it.</p>
<p><strong>Avarice (Macchariya)</strong></p>
<p>Macchariya is the nature of not tolerating something belonging to
oneself belonging to another, not tolerating another benefiting from
something belonging to oneself, not tolerating another receiving a
prosperity like one’s own prosperity, and hiding one’s own prosperity.
Stinginess is also a name for it.</p>
<p>(In the Dhammasaṅgaṇī, five kinds of Macchariya are preached: Avarice
regarding dwelling, family, gain, beauty, and Dhamma.)</p>
<p><strong>Worry (Kukkucca)</strong></p>
<p>Kukkucca is the nature of regretting about sins committed and merits
not committed.</p>
<p><strong>Sloth (Thīna) and Torpor (Middha)</strong></p>
<p>Thīna is the weakness of the mind, the inferiority of the mental
impulse, the lethargy of the mind. Middha is the weakness, the lethargy
of the mental factors. By the arising of Thīna and Middha, the mind
shrinks. Energy decreases. Sometimes sleepiness also arises.</p>
<p><strong>Doubt (Vicikicchā)</strong></p>
<p>Vicikicchā is the doubt regarding the object, the lack of confidence.
This is a Cetasika opposed to Faith and Wisdom. In this discussion of
the unwholesome, Vicikicchā refers to the doubts that are obstacles to
all wholesome actions in general, and especially to higher Dhammas like
Jhānas. Regarding unknown things, doubt like “is it like this or like
that?” arises in anyone. That is not this Vicikicchā Cetasika.
Unwholesome Vicikicchā consists of doubting the Buddha, doubting the
Dhamma, etc.</p>

<li>The Nineteen Beautiful Universal Mental Factors - Abhidhamma
Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-nineteen-beautiful-universal-mental-factors">5. The Nineteen
Beautiful Universal Mental Factors</h2>
<p><strong>Faith (Saddhā), Mindfulness (Sati), Shame (Hiri), Fear of
Wrongdoing (Ottappa), Non-Greed (Alobha), Non-Hatred (Adosa), Neutrality
of Mind (Tatramajjhattatā), Tranquillity of Mental Body (Kāyapassaddhi),
Tranquillity of Consciousness (Cittapassaddhi), Lightness of Mental Body
(Kāyalahutā), Lightness of Consciousness (Cittalahutā), Malleability of
Mental Body (Kāyamudutā), Malleability of Consciousness (Cittamudutā),

(Cittakammaññatā), Proficiency of Mental Body (Kāyapāguññatā),
Proficiency of Consciousness (Cittapāguññatā), Rectitude of Mental Body
(Kāyujjukatā), and Rectitude of Consciousness
(Cittujjukatā)</strong>—these nineteen Cetasikas are Beautiful Universal
Cetasikas.</p>
<p><strong>Faith (Saddhā)</strong></p>
<p>Saddhā is the trust in the Buddhas etc., the nature of accepting the
virtues of the Buddha etc. It is also called confidence. It is also
called “clarity/serenity” (prahāda/pasāda). This Faith is a great power
in performing merits. It is said to be like a hand in the sense of
taking merits, like wealth in the sense of obtaining all resources, and
like a seed since it is the root for all wholesome actions.</p>
<p><strong>Mindfulness (Sati)</strong></p>
<p>Remembrance/Awareness is Sati. The nature of the being’s mind is to
travel/exist in the unwholesome side. By this Cetasika, the being’s mind
is not allowed to travel in the unwholesome side and is established in
the wholesome side.</p>
<p><strong>Shame (Hiri) - Fear of Wrongdoing (Ottappa)</strong></p>
<p>Hiri is the nature of loathing sin, being ashamed of sin. Ottappa is
the nature of fearing sin. Because of these Hiri and Ottappa, virtuous
people refrain from sin and behave well.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Greed (Alobha)</strong></p>
<p>Alobha is the nature of not attaching to the object. The mind
associated with Alobha exists in the object without attaching, like
water on a lotus leaf. Alobha is a nature opposed to Greed.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Hatred (Adosa)</strong></p>
<p>Adosa is Loving-kindness (<em>Mettā</em>). It is the nature opposed
to Hatred.</p>
<p><strong>Neutrality of Mind (Tatramajjhattatā)</strong></p>
<p>The nature that maintains the speeds of the conascent Citta and
Cetasikas evenly, without allowing them to become deficient or
excessive, is called “<strong>Tatramajjhattatā</strong>.”</p>
<p><strong>Tranquillity of Mental Body (Kāyapassaddhi) - Tranquillity of
Consciousness (Cittapassaddhi)</strong></p>
<p>In <em>Kāyapassaddhi</em>, “Kāya” refers to the Cetasikas (Mental
Body). In <em>Cittapassaddhi</em>, “Citta” refers to the beautiful
consciousness. The calmness of the Cetasikas is “Kāyapassaddhi.” The
calmness of the Citta is “Cittapassaddhi.” These two Dhammas are opposed
to defilements like Restlessness (<em>Uddhacca</em>) that make Citta and
Cetasikas unpeaceful.</p>
<p><strong>Lightness of Mental Body (Kāyalahutā) - Lightness of
Consciousness (Cittalahutā)</strong></p>
<p>The lightness of Cetasikas is “Kāyalahutā.” The lightness of the mind
is “Cittalahutā.” These two Cetasikas are two Dhammas opposed to Sloth
and Torpor (<em>Thīna-Middha</em>) etc., which weaken Citta and
Cetasikas by bringing them to a state of heaviness like the body of a
sick person.</p>
<p><strong>Malleability of Mental Body (Kāyamudutā) - Malleability of
Consciousness (Cittamudutā)</strong></p>
<p>The softness of Cetasikas is “Kāyamudutā.” The softness of the mind
is “Cittamudutā.” These two Cetasikas are two Dhammas opposed to
defilements like Wrong View and Conceit (<em>Diṭṭhi-Māna</em>) which
make Citta and Cetasikas hard/stiff.</p>
<p><strong>Wieldiness of Mental Body (Kāyakammaññatā) - Wieldiness of
Consciousness (Cittakammaññatā)</strong></p>
<p>The wieldiness (fitness for work) of Cetasikas is “Kāyakammaññatā.”
The wieldiness of the mind is “Cittakammaññatā.” Wieldiness means being
suitable for wholesome action, just as gold is suitable for any fine
work. These two Cetasikas are opposed to defilements that make Citta and
Cetasikas unfit for action.</p>
<p><strong>Proficiency of Mental Body (Kāyapāguññatā) - Proficiency of
Consciousness (Cittapāguññatā)</strong></p>
<p>The proficiency (skillfulness/healthiness) of Cetasikas in respective
fields of action is “Kāyapāguññatā.” The proficiency of the mind is
“Cittapāguññatā.” These two Cetasikas are opposed to defilements like
lack of faith (<em>Assaddhā</em>) which bring Citta and Cetasikas to a
state of sickness or weakness.</p>
<p><strong>Rectitude of Mental Body (Kāyujjukatā) - Rectitude of
Consciousness (Cittujjukatā)</strong></p>
<p>The straightness (non-crookedness) of Cetasikas is “Kāyujjukatā.” The
straightness of the mind is “Cittujjukatā.” These two Dhammas are
opposed to deceit (<em>Māyā</em>), fraud (<em>Sāṭheyya</em>), etc.</p>
<p>Since these nineteen Cetasikas apply to all Beautiful Cittas without
exception, they are called Beautiful Universals (<em>Sobhana
Sādhāraṇa</em>).</p>

<li>The Six Variable Beautiful Mental Factors - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-six-variable-beautiful-mental-factors">6. The Six Variable
Beautiful Mental Factors</h2>
<p>The three Cetasikas: <strong>Right Speech (Sammā Vācā), Right Action
(Sammā Kammanta), and Right Livelihood (Sammā Ājīva)</strong> are called
<strong>Abstinences</strong> (<em>Virati</em>).</p>
<p>The nature of abstaining from the four bad deeds done by mouth:
lying, slandering, harsh speech, and frivolous talk, is called
“<strong>Right Speech</strong>.”</p>
<p>The nature of abstaining from the three bad deeds done by the body:
killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct, is called “<strong>Right
Action</strong>.”</p>
<p>Bad deeds done by body and speech are done as a means of livelihood
as well as for other reasons. The nature of abstaining from bodily and
verbal misconduct done for the sake of livelihood is called
“<strong>Right Livelihood</strong>.”</p>
<p>Since one abstains from bad deeds by means of these three Cetasikas,
those Cetasikas are called <strong>Virati</strong> (Abstinences).</p>
<p>The two Cetasikas <strong>Compassion (Karuṇā) and Appreciative Joy
(Muditā)</strong> are called <strong>Illimitables</strong>
(<em>Appamaññā</em>).</p>
<p>Just as one does not like suffering arising for oneself, the nature
of not liking others suffering either, the nature of wishing to free
others from suffering, the nature of trembling at the suffering of
others is called “<strong>Compassion</strong>.”</p>
<p>Just as one is happy if one receives some fortune, the nature of
being happy about the fortune of others is called “<strong>Appreciative
Joy</strong>.”</p>
<p>Since these two are maintained regarding immeasurable beings, they
are called Illimitables.</p>
<p>The nature that sees objects better, more purely, and more deeply
than knowing with the mind is the <strong>Wisdom Cetasika</strong>
(<em>Paññā Cetasika</em>). It is also called
“<strong>Non-Delusion</strong>” (<em>Amoha</em>) and
“<strong>Knowledge</strong>” (<em>Vijjā</em>).</p>
<p>The nineteen Beautiful Universal Cetasikas, the three Abstinences,
the two Illimitables, and the Wisdom Cetasika—these twenty-five
Cetasikas are called “<strong>Beautiful Cetasikas</strong>.”</p>
<p><strong>Special Notes</strong></p>
<p>Each Abstinence Cetasika is of three kinds: Natural Abstinence
(<em>Sampatta Virati</em>), Abstinence by Undertaking (<em>Samādāna
Virati</em>), and Abstinence by Eradication (<em>Samuccheda
Virati</em>). When an occasion to commit a bad deed arises, without
having undertaken precepts beforehand, or even if precepts were
undertaken without regarding them, considering only the evil of the sin,
the abstinence arising in one who refrains from sin is called
“<strong>Natural Abstinence</strong>.” The abstinence arising as
undertaking precepts and as protecting undertaken precepts is called
“<strong>Abstinence by Undertaking</strong>.” The abstinences arising
with the Supramundane Path Consciousness are called “<strong>Abstinence
by Eradication</strong>.”</p>
<p>There are four Illimitables: Loving-kindness, Compassion,
Appreciative Joy, and Equanimity. In these Beautiful Cetasikas, only two
Cetasikas are shown by the name Illimitables because Equanimity was
included in Beautiful Universal Cetasikas under the name Neutrality of
Mind (<em>Tatramajjhattatā</em>), and Loving-kindness was included under
the name Non-Hatred (<em>Adosa</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Memorize these.</strong></p>
<p>“Contact, Feeling, Perception, Volition, One-pointedness, Life
Faculty, Attention” are the seven Universal Mental Factors.</p>
<p>“Initial Application, Sustained Application, Decision, Energy, Zest,
Desire” are the six Occasional Mental Factors.</p>
<p>“Delusion, Shamelessness, Fearlessness of Wrongdoing, Restlessness,
Greed, Wrong View, Conceit, Hatred, Envy, Avarice, Worry, Sloth, Torpor,
Doubt” are the fourteen Unwholesome Mental Factors.</p>
<p>“Faith, Mindfulness, Shame, Fear of Wrongdoing, Non-Greed,
Non-Hatred, Neutrality of Mind, Tranquillity of Mental Body,
Tranquillity of Consciousness, Lightness of Mental Body, Lightness of
Consciousness, Malleability of Mental Body, Malleability of
Consciousness, Wieldiness of Mental Body, Wieldiness of Consciousness,
Proficiency of Mental Body, Proficiency of Consciousness, Rectitude of
Mental Body, Rectitude of Consciousness” are the nineteen Beautiful
Universal Mental Factors.</p>
<p>“Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood” are the three
Abstinences.</p>
<p>“Compassion, Appreciative Joy” are the two Illimitables. Together
with the “Wisdom” Cetasika, these twenty-five Cetasikas are Beautiful

<h2 id="association-of-ethically-variable-mental-factors">7. Association
of Ethically Variable Mental Factors</h2>
<p>To easily understand the association of Cetasikas, one should recall
the division of Cittas by Jhāna distinction and Feeling distinction. In
Rootless Unwholesome Resultants, there are five Cittas referred to by
the name Viññāṇa (Consciousness), such as Cakkhu Viññāṇa etc. In
Wholesome Resultants also there are five. It should be remembered that
the name <strong>Two Sets of Fivefold Sense Consciousness</strong>
(<em>Dvipañca Viññāṇa</em>) is used for those ten Cittas.</p>
<p>Among the fifty-two Cetasikas, know that the seven Universal
Cetasikas are associated with all Cittas without distinction. Among the
Occasional Cetasikas, <strong>Initial Application (Vitakka)</strong>
applies to fifty-five Cittas: the forty-four Sense-Sphere Cittas
excluding the ten Dvipañca Viññāṇas, and the eleven First Jhāna Cittas.
It does not apply to the remaining sixty-six Cittas.</p>
<p><strong>Sustained Application (Vicāra)</strong> applies to sixty-six
Cittas: the fifty-five Cittas where Vitakka applies, and the eleven
Second Jhāna Cittas. It does not apply to the remaining fifty-five
Cittas.</p>
<p><strong>Decision (Adhimokkha)</strong> applies to seventy-eight
Cittas, excluding the ten Dvipañca Viññāṇas and the Doubt-Associated
Citta. It does not apply to eleven Cittas.</p>
<p><strong>Energy (Viriya)</strong> applies to seventy-three Cittas,
excluding the sixteen Cittas: Five-door Adverting, the ten Dvipañca
Viññāṇas, the two Receiving Cittas, and the three Investigating Cittas.
It does not apply to sixteen Cittas.</p>
<p><strong>Zest (Pīti)</strong> applies to fifty-one Cittas, excluding
the seventy Cittas: two Displeasure-Accompanied Cittas, fifty-five
Equanimity-Accompanied Cittas, two Body Consciousnesses, and eleven
Fourth Jhāna Cittas. It does not apply to seventy Cittas.</p>
<p><strong>Desire (Chanda)</strong> applies to sixty-nine Cittas,
excluding the twenty Cittas: eighteen Rootless and two Delusion-Rooted
Cittas. It does not apply to twenty Cittas.</p>
<p><strong>Special Notes:</strong></p>
<p>For the Dvipañca Viññāṇas, which arise due to objects like forms
impinging on bases like the eye, no help from Vitakka is needed to go to
the object. Therefore, Vitakka does not apply to those Cittas. For
Cittas like the Second Jhāna, which have been developed by meditation to
be able to go to the object without Vitakka, Vitakka is also not
needed.</p>
<p>Since Dvipañca Viññāṇas are a weak group of Cittas, not even one
Occasional Cetasika applies to them. Vitakka does not apply to Second
Jhāna Cittas etc. because it has been abandoned by the power of
meditation.</p>
<p>Since Adhimokkha is a Cetasika with the nature of deciding, it does
not apply to the Doubt-Associated Citta. Viriya Cetasika does not apply
to Cittas like Five-door Adverting because those Cittas are weak.</p>
<p>Since Unpleasant and Equanimity Feelings are opposed to Zest, Zest
does not apply to Displeasure and Equanimity-Accompanied Cittas.
Although Body Consciousness is Pleasure-Accompanied, Zest does not apply
there because it is weak. Zest does not arise in the Joy-Accompanied
Fourth Jhāna Citta because it has been abandoned by the power of
meditation. Since Rootless Cittas and Delusion-Rooted Cittas are a weak
group of Cittas devoid of the desire to accomplish anything, Desire
(Chanda) does not apply to them.</p>
<p>When finding the number of Cetasikas applying to Cittas, it is these
six Occasional Cetasikas that often cause confusion. Therefore, the
association of those Cetasikas should be mastered well. The only Cittas
where not even one Occasional Cetasika applies are the ten Fivefold
Sense Consciousnesses. In the twenty-seven Cittas: four Greed-Rooted
Joy-Accompanied, twelve Sense-Sphere Beautiful Joy-Accompanied, and
eleven First Jhāna Cittas, all Occasional Cetasikas apply. In the
remaining Cittas, they apply appropriately. Since Universal Cetasikas
apply to all Cittas, there is nothing special to search about them. Find
the Occasional Cetasikas applying in all one hundred and twenty-one
Cittas, starting from the Joy-Accompanied View-Associated Unprompted
Citta. Practice until you can say it quickly.</p>

<h2 id="association-of-unwholesome-mental-factors">8. Association of
Unwholesome Mental Factors</h2>
<p>Among the Unwholesome Cetasikas, the four Cetasikas: <strong>Delusion
(Moha), Shamelessness (Ahirika), Fearlessness of Wrongdoing (Anottappa),
and Restlessness (Uddhacca)</strong> are Unwholesome Universals. Those
four apply to all Unwholesome Cittas without difference.</p>
<p><strong>Greed (Lobha)</strong> applies to the eight Greed-Rooted
Cittas. <strong>Wrong View (Diṭṭhi)</strong> applies to the four
View-Associated Cittas. <strong>Conceit (Māna)</strong> sometimes
applies to the four View-Dissociated Cittas.</p>
<p>The four: <strong>Hatred (Dosa), Envy (Issā), Avarice (Macchariya),
and Worry (Kukkucca)</strong> apply to the two Hatred-Rooted Cittas. Of
them, Envy, Avarice, and Worry apply only on some occasions.</p>
<p><strong>Sloth and Torpor (Thīna - Middha)</strong> apply to the five
Prompted Cittas. They also apply only on some occasions. “<strong>Doubt
(Vicikicchā)</strong>” applies only to the Doubt-Associated Citta.</p>
<p>There are four Cetasikas applying to all Unwholesome Cittas. There
are three Cetasikas applying only to Greed-Rooted Cittas. There are four
Cetasikas applying only to Hatred-Rooted Cittas. There are two Cetasikas
applying only to Unwholesome Prompted Cittas. There is one Cetasika
applying only to the Doubt-Associated Citta. Find the Unwholesome
Cetasikas applying in the twelve Unwholesome Cittas in order.</p>
<p><strong>Special Notes</strong></p>
<p>If there is wisdom seeing the fault of unwholesome deeds, unwholesome
Cittas do not arise. Similarly, when there is Hiri loathing
unwholesomeness and Ottappa fearing it, unwholesome Cittas do not arise.
When the mind is established in the field of wholesome Dhamma,
unwholesome Cittas do not arise either. For every unwholesome Citta to
arise, there must be Delusion covering its danger, Shamelessness not
ashamed of it, Fearlessness not fearing it, and Restlessness shaking.
Therefore, it is said that the four: Moha, Ahirika, Anottappa, and
Uddhacca apply to all unwholesome Cittas.</p>
<p>The View taking “the five aggregates are a self, an eternal thing”
etc. arises, and the Conceit taking “I am superior” etc. arises,
together with the Greed attached to the five aggregates. Therefore, the
two Cetasikas Diṭṭhi and Māna arise only in Greed-Rooted Cittas and not
in any other Citta. Taking as eternal etc., and taking as superior etc.,
are two different things, so they never arise together in one Citta at
once. That is why Conceit does not apply to View-Associated Cittas.</p>
<p>Avarice (Macchariya) arises due to greed attached to one’s own
possessions. However, since it arises as intolerance of one’s
possessions being common to others, it arises with Hatred and not with
Greed. That is why it was said that Macchariya arises only in
Hatred-Rooted Consciousness.</p>
<p>The two Cetasikas Sloth and Torpor, which weaken the mind and make it
unfit for work, apply only to weak Prompted Cittas. They apply to
Prompted Cittas only on some occasions. They do not apply at all
times.</p>

<h2 id="association-of-beautiful-mental-factors">9. Association of
Beautiful Mental Factors</h2>
<p>Among the Beautiful Cetasikas, the nineteen Beautiful Universal
Cetasikas apply without difference to all Beautiful Cittas, which are
fifty-nine by the brief method and ninety-one by the detailed
method.</p>
<p>The three Abstinence (<em>Virati</em>) Cetasikas always apply
together in Supramundane Cittas. In Mundane Cittas, specifically in the
eight Sense-Sphere Wholesome Cittas, they apply separately on some
occasions. Only one of the Abstinences applies at a time in Sense-Sphere
Wholesome.</p>
<p>The two Illimitables (<em>Appamaññā</em>) Cetasikas apply separately
on some occasions in twenty-eight Cittas: the twelve First, Second,
Third, and Fourth Jhāna Fine-material-sphere Cittas, eight Sense-Sphere
Wholesome, and eight Sense-Sphere Functional with Roots. Compassion and
Appreciative Joy do not apply together at once in one Citta. There is
also a teacher’s opinion that “Compassion and Appreciative Joy do not
apply to Equanimity-Accompanied Cittas but only to Joy-Accompanied
Cittas.” According to that opinion, there are twenty Cittas where
Compassion and Appreciative Joy apply.</p>
<p>The Wisdom (<em>Paññā</em>) Cetasika applies to forty-seven Cittas:
twelve Sense-Sphere Cittas Associated with Knowledge, fifteen
Fine-material-sphere Cittas, twelve Immaterial-sphere Cittas, and eight
Supramundane Cittas.</p>
<p>The nineteen Beautiful Universals apply in fifty-nine Cittas; the
three Abstinences in sixteen Cittas; the two Illimitables in
twenty-eight Cittas; and the Wisdom Cetasika in forty-seven Cittas.</p>
<p>Now find out in order how many Beautiful Cetasikas apply to each
Beautiful Citta. Since the nineteen Beautiful Universals apply to all
Beautiful Cittas, there is nothing new to search about them. There are
only six Beautiful Cetasikas that apply only with some Cittas.
Therefore, finding the number of Cetasikas is not difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Special Notes</strong></p>
<p>Regarding the application of Abstinence Cetasikas in Sense-Sphere
Wholesome Consciousness, two facts should be specially noted: applying
sometimes, and when applying, not all applying at once but applying
separately. In Sense-Sphere Wholesome Consciousness performing giving
alms, worshipping, preaching Dhamma, listening to Dhamma, etc.,
Abstinence Cetasikas do not apply. They apply only on occasions where
virtue is perfected by abstaining from misconduct with Sense-Sphere
Wholesome Consciousness. Abstaining from all misconduct cannot be done
at once. At the time of abstaining from verbal misconduct, abstaining
from bodily misconduct does not occur. At the time of abstaining from
bodily misconduct, abstaining from verbal misconduct does not occur. At
the time of abstaining from lying with the Right Speech Cetasika, only
abstaining from lying occurs, not abstaining from slandering etc. At the
time of abstaining from slandering, abstaining from lying etc. does not
occur. Because of these reasons, only one Abstinence Cetasika applies at
a time in Sense-Sphere Wholesome, not two or three. Since Fine-material
and Immaterial-sphere Cittas are not Cittas arising as abstinence from
misconduct, Abstinence Cetasikas do not apply to them.</p>
<p>Sins are committed by beings due to defilements. Defilements causing
sins are destroyed by the Supramundane Path Consciousness. Since
abstinence from sins occurs according to the destruction of defilements,
all three Abstinence Cetasikas always apply with Supramundane
Cittas.</p>
<p>Illimitables apply in Sense-Sphere Cittas only on occasions of being
compassionate to suffering beings and being happy about happy ones.
Since being compassionate and being happy about happy ones are two
different tasks, both Illimitable Cetasikas do not apply in one Citta at
once. Illimitables do not apply to Fine-material-sphere Cittas taking
Kasiṇas etc. as objects. They apply only to Fine-material-sphere Jhāna
Cittas developed by cultivating Compassion or Appreciative Joy.</p>
<p>Among the fifty-two Cetasikas, the eleven Cetasikas: Envy, Avarice,
Worry, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Compassion,
Appreciative Joy, Conceit, Sloth, and Torpor apply only sometimes in
specific Cittas. Therefore, they are called ‘<strong>Unfixed
Adjuncts</strong>’ (<em>Aniyatayogi</em>). Since the remaining forty-one
Cetasikas definitely apply in their respective Cittas, they are called
‘<strong>Fixed Adjuncts</strong>’ (<em>Niyatayogi</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In which Cittas do Abstinence Cetasikas always apply?</li>

Compendium of Mental Factors in Unwholesome Consciousness</h2>
<p>Now you know in which Cittas each Cetasika applies. From here on,
what should be done is to find the number of Cetasikas applying to each
Citta for every Citta. From here onwards, the number of Cetasikas
applying to those respective Cittas will be shown in the order the
Cittas were presented in the Citta Chapter.</p>
<p>There are twenty-seven Cetasikas applying to Unwholesome Cittas:
thirteen Ethically Variable Cetasikas and fourteen Unwholesome
Cetasikas. To make searching for Cetasikas easier for you, first find
the Cetasikas that apply to all Unwholesome Cittas from those
twenty-seven Cetasikas. When you first keep in mind that these fourteen
Cetasikas—the seven Universal Mental Factors, the three Occasional
Mental Factors: Initial Application, Sustained Application, Energy, and
the four Unwholesome Universal Mental Factors: Delusion, Shamelessness,
Fearlessness of Wrongdoing, Restlessness—apply to all Unwholesome
Cittas, you will be able to easily find the other Cetasikas applying to
each Citta.</p>
<p>In the first Greed-Rooted Citta, the Joy-Accompanied View-Associated
Unprompted Citta, apart from the fourteen Cetasikas mentioned above, the
three Ethically Variable: Decision, Zest, Desire, and the two
Unwholesome Cetasikas: Greed, View, apply additionally.</p>

Cittas, and the Wisdom Cetasika does not apply in Knowledge-Dissociated
Cittas. Illimitables and Abstinences do not apply in Resultants.
Illimitables apply in Functionals. Abstinences do not apply. If these
few facts are kept in mind, the Cetasikas applying in Sense-Sphere
Beautiful Cittas can be easily found.</p>
<p>In the first and second Sense-Sphere Wholesome Cittas, all
thirty-eight Cetasikas: thirteen Ethically Variable and twenty-five
Beautiful, apply. It should be remembered that Abstinences and
Illimitables apply only sometimes everywhere. Since the third and fourth
Cittas are Knowledge-Dissociated, thirty-seven apply in them, excluding
the Wisdom Cetasika. Since the fifth and sixth Cittas are
Equanimity-Accompanied, thirty-seven Cetasikas apply: twelve Ethically
Variable excluding Zest, and twenty-five Beautiful Cetasikas. In the
seventh and eighth Cittas, thirty-six Cetasikas apply: twelve Ethically
Variable excluding Zest, and twenty-four Beautiful Cetasikas excluding
Wisdom since they are Knowledge-Dissociated.</p>
<p>In the first and second Resultant Cittas, thirty-three Cetasikas
apply: thirteen Ethically Variable and twenty Beautiful Cetasikas
excluding Abstinences and Illimitables. Since the third and fourth
Cittas are Knowledge-Dissociated, thirty-two apply in them, excluding
Knowledge from the aforementioned thirty-three. In the fifth and sixth
Cittas, thirty-two Cetasikas apply: twelve Ethically Variable excluding
Zest, nineteen Beautiful Universals, and Wisdom. Thirty-one Cetasikas
apply in the seventh and eighth Cittas, excluding Knowledge from
those.</p>
<p>In the first two Functional Cittas, thirty-five Cetasikas apply:
thirteen Ethically Variable, nineteen Beautiful Universals, two
Illimitables, and Wisdom. In the third and fourth two Cittas,
thirty-four apply, excluding Knowledge from those Cetasikas. In the
fifth and sixth Cittas, thirty-four Cetasikas apply: twelve Ethically

<p>Thirteen Ethically Variable and twenty-three Beautiful Cetasikas

<p>In the eight Supramundane First Jhāna Cittas, thirty-six Cetasikas

excluding Illimitables. In the eight Second Jhāna Cittas, thirty-five

Cittas, thirty-four Cetasikas apply, excluding both Initial Application
and Sustained Application. In the sixteen Fourth Jhāna and Fifth Jhāna
Cittas, thirty-three Cetasikas apply, excluding Initial Application,
Sustained Application, and Zest.</p>
<p>Supramundane Cittas arise taking Nibbāna as object. Illimitable
Cetasikas arise taking beings as object. Due to the difference in
objects, Illimitables do not arise in Supramundane Consciousness.
Abstinences do not apply to Sublime Cittas because those Cittas arise
taking Kasiṇas etc. as object.</p>
<p>The maximum number of Cetasikas applying at once is in the
Supramundane First Jhāna Cittas. Although it is said that thirty-eight
Cetasikas generally apply in Sense-Sphere Wholesome, the maximum number
of Cetasikas that can apply at once there is thirty-four. The lowest
number of Cetasikas apply in the Two Sets of Fivefold Sense
Consciousness.</p>

<p>There are three feelings: <strong>Pleasant Feeling, Painful Feeling,
and Equanimous Feeling</strong>. By another method, there are five
feelings: <strong>Pleasure, Pain, Joy, Displeasure, and
Equanimity</strong>.</p>
<p>What is called Feeling (<em>Vedanā</em>) here is the Feeling
Cetasika, which is one of the fifty-two Cetasikas. It has been analyzed
and shown in various ways by the Tathāgata in many places.
<strong>Feeling is the experiencing of the taste of the object.</strong>
The taste of the object is experienced as sweetness. The taste of the
object is experienced as bitterness. The taste of the object is
experienced as neutral. Apart from these three modes, there are no other
modes of experiencing the taste of the object. Therefore, feeling is of
three kinds according to the experiencing of the taste of the object.
Here, feeling is shown in five ways according to the <strong>Faculty
(Indriya) Teaching</strong>. In the Faculty Teaching, Bodily Pleasant
Feeling is called Pleasure Faculty (<em>Sukhindriya</em>), Mental
Pleasant Feeling is called Joy Faculty (<em>Somanassindriya</em>),
Bodily Painful Feeling is called Pain Faculty (<em>Dukkhindriya</em>),
Mental Painful Feeling is called Displeasure Faculty
(<em>Domanassindriya</em>), and Equanimity Feeling is called Equanimity
Faculty (<em>Upekkhindriya</em>).</p>
<p>Cittas associated with respective feelings can be easily found as

other things to arise. In this Abhidhamma, the name Root is used for the
six Dhammas starting with Greed, not because they are causes for
something to arise. Just as roots help trees to stand firm in the ground
without falling, the six starting with Greed help the Citta and
Cetasikas to stand firm in the object.</p>
<p>Greed sticks firmly in the object of greed. The consciousness and
mental factors associated with it stand unshaken in that object because
of Greed. Hatred sticks firmly in the object. Citta and Cetasikas
associated with it also stand unshaken in the object with its help.
Because of Delusion etc. also, the associated Citta and Cetasikas stand
unshaken in the object. In this Dhamma, the name Root is used for Greed
etc. because they are Dhammas helpful for the associated Citta and
Cetasikas to stand unshaken in the object. <strong>Dhammas that help
associated Dhammas to stand unshaken in the object are called
Roots.</strong> There are four kinds of Roots. These are called
<strong>Root Causes</strong> (<em>Mūla Hetu</em>). Everywhere in
Abhidhamma, the rootless and rooted nature of ultimate realities is
stated regarding the presence or absence of these Root Causes.</p>
<p>The eighteen Cittas mentioned by the name Rootless in the Citta
Chapter are Rootless Cittas because they lack Root Causes. The remaining
seventy-one Cittas are Rooted (<em>Sahetuka</em>) Cittas because they
possess roots.</p>
<p>Greed, Hatred, and Delusion are the three Unwholesome Roots. One or
two of them are obtained in one Citta. Therefore, there are One-rooted
(<em>Ekahetuka</em>) and Two-rooted (<em>Dvihetuka</em>) unwholesome,
but no Three-rooted (<em>Tihetuka</em>) unwholesome. The three roots
Non-Greed etc. are also Wholesome Roots. They are also Roots that are
neither Wholesome nor Unwholesome (Indeterminate - <em>Abyākata</em>).
In some Cittas, all three roots Non-Greed etc. are obtained. In some
Cittas, two are obtained excluding the Non-Delusion root. There is no
Citta where only one of Non-Greed etc. is obtained.</p>
<p>The two Delusion-Rooted Cittas are One-rooted Cittas because they
have only the single root Delusion. The remaining ten Unwholesome Cittas
and the twelve Knowledge-Dissociated Sense-Sphere Beautiful Cittas,
totaling twenty-two, are Two-rooted Cittas. The remaining forty-seven
Cittas are Three-rooted Cittas.</p>

<li>Compendium of Functions - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="compendium-of-functions">3. Compendium of Functions</h2>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong></p>
<p>The Cittas shown in the Citta Chapter arise in beings performing
various functions (tasks) according to a certain method. The streams of
Cittas arising in beings regarding respective matters are called
“<strong>Cognitive Processes</strong>” (<em>Citta Vīthi</em>). When
presenting <strong>Citta Vīthis</strong>, names used for Cittas in the
Citta Chapter such as Unwholesome Citta, Greed-Rooted Citta,
Hatred-Rooted Citta, etc., are not used. In presenting Vīthis, Cittas
are identified by names received by those respective Cittas according to
the function performed by them. Therefore, to be able to learn the
Cognitive Process section, this Compendium of Functions must be well
mastered.</p>
<p><strong>There are fourteen functions performed by Cittas:
Rebirth-Linking (<em>Paṭisandhi</em>) Function, Life-Continuum
(<em>Bhavanga</em>) Function, Adverting (<em>Āvajjana</em>) Function,
Seeing (<em>Dassana</em>) Function, Hearing (<em>Savana</em>) Function,
Smelling (<em>Ghāyana</em>) Function, Tasting (<em>Sāyana/Assādana</em>)
Function, Touching (<em>Phusana</em>) Function, Receiving
(<em>Sampaṭicchana</em>) Function, Investigating (<em>Santīraṇa</em>)
Function, Determining (<em>Votthapana</em>) Function, Impulsion
(<em>Javana</em>) Function, Registration (<em>Tadālambana</em>)
Function, and Death (<em>Cuti</em>) Function.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There is not a single Citta that does not perform at least
one of these fourteen functions. Some Cittas perform two, three, four,
or five functions each.</strong></p>
<p>Connecting the present existence and the future existence without
allowing the stream of consciousness to be cut off by death is the
<strong>Rebirth-Linking Function</strong>.</p>
<p>Maintaining the stream of consciousness without allowing it to be cut
off after being born in the new existence is the <strong>Life-Continuum
Function</strong>.</p>
<p>Directing/turning the stream of consciousness to a certain object so
that a cognitive process arises is the <strong>Adverting
Function</strong>.</p>
<p>Seeing forms or knowing them is the <strong>Seeing
Function</strong>.</p>
<p>Hearing sounds or knowing them is the <strong>Hearing
Function</strong>.</p>
<p>Smelling sweet/foul odors or knowing them is the <strong>Smelling
Function</strong>.</p>
<p>Tasting the flavor of food etc. or knowing it is the <strong>Tasting
Function</strong>.</p>
<p>Knowing what touches the body is the <strong>Touching
Function</strong>.</p>
<p>Receiving the forms etc. taken by Eye-consciousness etc. is the
<strong>Receiving Function</strong>.</p>
<p>Investigating the forms etc. received by Receiving is the
<strong>Investigating Function</strong>.</p>
<p>Determining the nature of the investigated object is the
<strong>Determining Function</strong>.</p>
<p>The excessive mental impulse regarding knowing the object and
regarding actions such as giving and taking is the <strong>Impulsion
(Javana) Function</strong>.</p>
<p>Taking the object taken by Javana is the <strong>Registration
Function</strong>.</p>
<p>Ending the existence—departing from existence—is the <strong>Death
Function</strong>.</p>
<p>You cannot currently form a proper understanding of these functions
performed by Cittas. A proper understanding of them arises when learning
Cognitive Processes. What you should do now is to remember well the
functions and the Cittas that perform them. If not done so, learning the
Vīthi section will be difficult.</p>
<p>In one existence, only one Rebirth-Linking Citta arises for one
person. Death Citta is also one. Bhavanga Cittas arise abundantly in
beings. However, their arising is not felt. The main part of Cittas is
Javana Cittas. Apart from Bhavanga Cittas, mostly Javana Cittas arise in
a being. It is Javana Cittas that know the object well, perform actions,
and become merit and demerit.</p>
<p><strong>Part II</strong></p>
<p>The two Equanimity-Accompanied Investigating Cittas, eight Great
Resultants, and nine Sublime Resultants—these nineteen Cittas perform
the three functions: Rebirth-Linking, Life-Continuum, and Death.
Although each of these Cittas performs all three functions, it performs
only one function at a time.</p>
<p>The two Cittas: Five-door Adverting and Mind-door Adverting perform
the Adverting function.</p>
<p>The Seeing function is performed by the two Eye-consciousnesses; the
Hearing function by the two Ear-consciousnesses; the Smelling function
by the two Nose-consciousnesses; the Tasting function by the two
Tongue-consciousnesses; the Touching function by the two
Body-consciousnesses; and the Receiving function by the two Receiving
Cittas.</p>
<p>The Investigating function is performed by the three Investigating
Cittas.</p>
<p>The Determining function is also performed by the Mind-door Adverting
Citta.</p>
<p>Twelve Unwholesome Cittas, Smile-producing Citta, eight Great
Wholesome Cittas, eight Great Functional Cittas, nine Sublime Wholesome
Cittas, nine Sublime Functional Cittas, and eight Supramundane
Cittas—these fifty-five Cittas are Javana Cittas.</p>
<p>The eight Great Resultants and the three Investigating Cittas—these
eleven are Cittas with the Registration function.</p>
<p>Two Equanimity-Accompanied Investigating Cittas perform five
functions: Rebirth-Linking, Life-Continuum, Death, Investigating, and
Registration.</p>
<p>Eight Great Resultants perform four functions: Rebirth-Linking,
Life-Continuum, Death, and Registration.</p>
<p>Nine Sublime Resultants perform three functions as: Rebirth-Linking,
Life-Continuum, and Death.</p>
<p>Joy-Accompanied Investigating performs two functions: Investigating
and Registration.</p>
<p>Mind-door Adverting performs two functions: Determining and
Adverting.</p>
<p>Fifty-five Javana Cittas, Five-door Adverting, two Receiving, and ten
Fivefold Sense Consciousnesses—these sixty-eight Cittas perform only one
function. Even of Cittas that perform two or three functions, know that
they perform only one function at a time.</p>

<li>Compendium of Doors - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="compendium-of-doors">4. Compendium of Doors</h2>
<p><strong>Part I</strong></p>
<p>Places of entry and exit are called “<strong>Doors</strong>”
(<em>Dvāra</em>). There are places in the bodies of beings where objects
like forms enter the being’s continuity, and where the mind goes towards
objects like forms. In this Abhidhamma, they are identified by the name
Door. Streams of Cittas flow towards objects like forms through those
doors. Therefore, the person learning Abhidhamma must also know about
those doors.</p>
<p>There are six doors: <strong>Eye-door, Ear-door, Nose-door,
Tongue-door, Body-door, and Mind-door</strong>.</p>
<p>In the middle of the black pupil of the eye, there is a place where
the reflection of objects in front falls. It is said to be the size of a
louse’s head. It is also called Eye-sensitivity (<em>Cakkhu
Pasāda</em>). It is also what is called the Eye-door. The falling of the
reflection of objects in front onto it is the entering of the Form
Object (<em>Rūpārammaṇa</em>) into the being’s continuity. Because of
that, the arising of a stream of Cittas such as Five-door Adverting -
Eye-consciousness - Receiving - Investigating etc. regarding the
external form is the going of the mind towards the Form Object. Thus,
since the entering of the Form Object and the exiting of Cittas occur,
Eye-sensitivity is a door.</p>
<p>There is a place in the ear where sound impinges—where sound is
reflected. It is also called Ear-sensitivity (<em>Sota Pasāda</em>).
That Ear-sensitivity is the Ear-door.</p>
<p>In the nose also, there is a place where smells impinge causing
Cittas knowing smell to arise. It is called Nose-sensitivity (<em>Ghāna
Pasāda</em>). It is also what is called the Nose-door.</p>
<p>In the tongue also, there is a place where taste impinges. It is
called Tongue-sensitivity (<em>Jivhā Pasāda</em>). That
Tongue-sensitivity is the Tongue-door.</p>
<p>There is a certain subtle thing spread in the body helpful for
knowing touch. It is called Body-sensitivity (<em>Kāya Pasāda</em>). It
is to that Body-sensitivity that Body-door is said. Details regarding
the five sensitivities can be known in the Matter Chapter.</p>
<p>The natural consciousness called <em>Bhavanga</em> itself is the
Mind-door. The Mind-door helps to know the five objects such as form and
sound that can be known in the five doors, and various things not within
the scope of the five doors.</p>
<p><strong>Part II</strong></p>
<p>Forty-six Cittas arise in the Eye-door: Five-door Adverting, two
Eye-consciousnesses, two Receiving, three Investigating, Determining
(Mind-door Adverting) Citta, twenty-nine Sense-Sphere Javanas, and
eleven Registration Cittas.</p>
<p>Cittas are shown as Five-door Adverting etc. according to the order
Cittas arise in the Eye-door. If the number of Cittas is added as
stated, it becomes forty-nine. That is because the three Investigating
Cittas are included again in Registration. To get the exact number of
Cittas, excluding the Investigating counted once, Registration should be
counted as eight. Here, eleven Registration Cittas were mentioned
because the three Investigating Cittas also arise as Registration.</p>
<p>Of the forty-six Cittas arising in the Eye-door, only the two
Eye-consciousnesses arise <em>only</em> there. The remaining forty-four
Cittas arise in the Ear, Nose, Tongue, and Body doors as well. A part of
them arises in the Mind-door too.</p>
<p>Excluding the two Eye-consciousnesses, forty-four Cittas arising in
the Eye-door, and two Ear-consciousnesses—these forty-six Cittas are
Cittas arising in the Ear-door.</p>
<p>The aforementioned forty-four Cittas and two
Nose-consciousnesses—these forty-six Cittas arise in the Nose-door.</p>
<p>In the Tongue-door and Body-door also, forty-six Cittas arise
respectively. To the aforementioned forty-four Cittas, add two
Tongue-consciousnesses and two Body-consciousnesses to get the Citta
count. Only the fifty-four Sense-Sphere Cittas arise in all five doors
starting with the Eye. Fine-material-sphere, Immaterial-sphere, and
Supramundane Cittas do not arise in the five doors.</p>
<p>In the Mind-door, sixty-seven Cittas arise: Mind-door Adverting,
fifty-five Javanas, and eleven Registration Cittas.</p>
<p>The nineteen Cittas performing Rebirth-Linking, Life-Continuum, and
Death functions are Cittas that do not arise in doors, as they
themselves are the Mind-door. They are <strong>Door-freed</strong>
(<em>Dvāra-vimutta</em>) Cittas. The remaining seventy Cittas are Cittas
arising in doors. They are called <strong>Door-associated</strong>
(<em>Dvārika</em>) Cittas.</p>
<p>Among the eighty-nine Cittas, there are Cittas arising only in one
door. There are Cittas arising in five doors. There are Cittas arising
in all six doors. There are Cittas that are sometimes Door-associated
and sometimes Door-freed. There are also Cittas that are always
Door-freed.</p>
<p>Thirty-six Cittas—the ten Dvipañca Viññāṇas and twenty-six Sublime
and Supramundane Javanas—are Cittas arising in only one door. The
Five-door Adverting and the two Receiving Cittas, which are called
<strong>Mind Element</strong> (<em>Mano Dhātu</em>), are Five-door
Cittas. Thirty-one Cittas—Joy-Accompanied Investigating, Mind-door
Adverting, and twenty-nine Sense Javanas—are Cittas arising in all six
doors. Ten Cittas—two Equanimity-Accompanied Investigating and eight
Great Resultants—are sometimes Six-door and sometimes Door-freed. Those
Cittas arise in all six doors through the Registration function. When
arising by way of Rebirth-Linking, Life-Continuum, and Death functions,
they are Door-freed. The nine Sublime Resultants are always
Door-freed.</p>

<li>Compendium of Objects - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="compendium-of-objects">5. Compendium of Objects</h2>
<p><strong>Part I</strong></p>
<p>“Object (<em>Ārammaṇa</em>)” is the name given to things felt by the
mind—caught by the mind—grasped by the mind.</p>
<p>There are also six Objects according to doors: <strong>Form Object,
Sound Object, Smell Object, Taste Object, Tangible Object, and Mental
Object</strong>.</p>
<p>The color existing in substances is the <strong>Form Object</strong>
(<em>Rūpārammaṇa</em>). Only the Form Object is visible to the eye. It
is color, not objects, that is visible to the eye. Everything has a
color. However, the color of very subtle things is not visible to our
eyes.</p>
<p>The thing felt by the Ear-faculty or ear is the <strong>Sound
Object</strong> (<em>Saddārammaṇa</em>).</p>
<p>Good and bad smells felt by the nose are the <strong>Smell
Object</strong> (<em>Gandhārammaṇa</em>).</p>
<p>Tastes felt by the tongue are the <strong>Taste Object</strong>
(<em>Rasārammaṇa</em>).</p>
<p>Hardness, softness, coolness, heat, etc. felt by the Body-faculty are
the <strong>Tangible Object</strong> (<em>Phoṭṭhabbārammaṇa</em>).</p>
<p>Everything felt by the mind—caught by the mind excluding the five
objects such as form, is called the <strong>Mental Object</strong>
(<em>Dhammārammaṇa</em>). The Mental Object is sixfold: Sensitive Matter
(<em>Pasāda Rūpa</em>), Subtle Matter (<em>Sukhuma Rūpa</em>),
Consciousness (<em>Citta</em>), Mental Factors (<em>Cetasika</em>),
Nibbāna, and Concepts (<em>Paññatti</em>). These will be known in the
future. For now, just remember the six parts by name.</p>
<p>There are four groups of objects: Past, Future, Present, and
Independent of Time (<em>Kālavimutta</em>). Things that have arisen and
perished are called “<strong>Past Objects</strong>.” Things that will
arise in the future are called “<strong>Future Objects</strong>.” Things
existing now are called “<strong>Present Objects</strong>.” This
division of time applies to things that have arising and perishing.
Nibbāna and Concepts do not have arising and perishing. Therefore, they
are not included in any of the three times. They are called
“<strong>Independent of Time</strong>.” (This is a deep matter. Ask
teachers for further details.)</p>
<p>Only the present Form Object becomes the object for the forty-six
Eye-door Cittas. Past and future forms are not caught by Eye-door
Cittas. Similarly, present Sound, Smell, Taste, and Tangible objects
become objects for Cittas belonging to the Ear, Nose, Tongue, and Body
doors.</p>
<p>For Mind-door Cittas, the six objects: Form, Sound, Smell, Taste,
Tangible, and Mental Object belonging to all three times, and also
Nibbāna and Concepts which are Independent of Time, become objects.</p>
<p>For Door-freed Cittas, the six objects which are present, past, or
concepts—known as Kamma, Sign of Kamma, or Sign of Destiny that were the
object of the death-proximate Javanas of the immediately preceding past
existence—become objects.</p>
<p><strong>Part II</strong></p>
<p>What was shown above were the objects of Cittas indefinitely by way
of doors. The object belonging to each specific Citta should be known as
stated below.</p>
<p>The two Eye-consciousnesses take only Form as object. Ear, Nose,
Tongue, and Body consciousnesses take Sound, Smell, Taste, and Tangible
objects respectively.</p>
<p>The three Cittas—Five-door Adverting and the two Receiving
Cittas—which are called Mind Element (<em>Mano Dhātu</em>), take the
five objects such as form etc.</p>
<p>Excluding the ten Dvipañca Viññāṇas and the Mind Element, the
remaining eleven Sense-Sphere Resultant Cittas and the Smile-producing
Citta—these twelve Cittas take Sense-Sphere Dhammas as object.
“<strong>Sense-Sphere Dhamma</strong>” refers to the fifty-four
Sense-Sphere Cittas, the Cetasikas applying in them, and the
twenty-eight Rūpas.</p>
<p>The twelve Unwholesome Cittas and the eight Knowledge-Dissociated
Sense-Sphere Javana Cittas take all objects except the nine Supramundane
Dhammas. “<strong>Nine Supramundane Dhammas</strong>” refer to the eight
Supramundane Cittas and Nibbāna.</p>
<p>The four Joy-Accompanied Consciousnesses Associated with Knowledge
and the Rūpāvacara Fifth Jhāna Wholesome Citta which has reached the
state of Direct Knowledge (<em>Abhiññā</em>)—these five Cittas take all
objects except the Arahant Path and Arahant Fruit.</p>
<p>The four Sense-Sphere Functional Cittas Associated with Knowledge,
the Rūpāvacara Fifth Jhāna Functional Citta which has reached the state
of Direct Knowledge, and the Mind-door Adverting Citta—these six Cittas
take all objects.</p>
<p>“Omniscient Knowledge” (<em>Sabbaññutā Ñāṇa</em>) refers to the
wisdom in the Great Functional Cittas Associated with Knowledge arising
in Supreme Buddhas. Just by obtaining Jhāna, one cannot perform psychic
powers. The power of psychic powers exists only in the two Rūpāvacara
Wholesome and Functional Fifth Jhāna Cittas. Even the ordinary Fifth
Jhāna Citta does not have that power. To obtain that power, the Fifth
Jhāna Citta must be further developed. The Fifth Jhāna Citta developed
thus is called “<strong>Direct Knowledge Consciousness</strong>”
(<em>Abhiññā Citta</em>). Whoever performs psychic powers, everyone does
so with the Direct Knowledge Consciousness. Supramundane Cittas do not
have the capability to perform psychic powers.</p>
<p>Of the Immaterial-sphere Cittas, the three Consciousnesses of the
Base of Infinite Consciousness take the Consciousness of the Base of
Infinite Space as object. The three Consciousnesses of the Base of
Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception take the Consciousness of the Base
of Nothingness as object. Since the Consciousnesses of the Base of
Infinite Space and the Base of Infinite Consciousness are Sublime
(<em>Mahaggata</em>), the six Cittas: Consciousness of the Base of
Infinite Consciousness and Consciousness of the Base of
Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception, which take them as object, are
called “<strong>Sublime-Object Cittas</strong>.”</p>
<p>The fifteen Fine-material-sphere Cittas, the three Consciousnesses of
the Base of Infinite Space, and the three Consciousnesses of the Base of
Nothingness—these twenty-one Cittas take Concepts (<em>Paññatti</em>)
such as Kasiṇas as object.</p>
<p>Supramundane Cittas take Nibbāna as object.</p>
<p>There are twenty-five Cittas taking Sense-Sphere Dhammas as object.
There are six Cittas taking Sublime Dhammas as object. There are
twenty-one Cittas taking Concepts as object. There are eight Cittas
taking Nibbāna as object. There are twenty Cittas taking all objects
except Supramundane Dhammas. There are five Cittas taking all objects
except Arahant Path and Fruit. There are six Cittas taking all
objects.</p>

<li>Compendium of Bases - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="compendium-of-bases">6. Compendium of Bases</h2>
<p>In this Dhamma, the name “<strong>Base</strong>” (<em>Vatthu</em>) is
used for the places in the bodies of beings where Cittas arise.</p>
<p>There are six Bases or places where Cittas arise: <strong>Eye-base,
Ear-base, Nose-base, Tongue-base, Body-base, and
Heart-base</strong>.</p>
<p>The Eye-base is the Eye-sensitivity mentioned as Eye-door in the
Compendium of Doors. Ear, Nose, Tongue, and Body bases are also those
respective sensitive Rūpas.</p>
<p>The special item among bases is the Heart-base (<em>Hadaya
Vatthu</em>). It is a certain subtle element existing in dependence on
the blood, about half a cup in quantity, located in the heart. It is a
very subtle thing invisible to the eye and not tangible to the hand. It
is not present in the heart of the dead. It is also not something
captured by medical science. The name Base-Matter (<em>Vatthu Rūpa</em>)
is also used for it. Although blood flows out of the heart, that
Base-Matter which helps the arising of thoughts does not flow out mixed
with the blood leaving the heart. Most Cittas arise in the
Heart-base.</p>
<p>Beings with complete faculties in the Sense World have all six bases.
Brahmas in the Fine-Material World do not have Nose, Tongue, and Body
bases. Immaterial beings do not have even a single base.</p>
<p>By saying there are no Nose, Tongue, and Body bases in the
Fine-Material World, it should not be taken that Fine-material Brahmas
do not have a nose, tongue, and body. What they lack are the Nose,
Tongue, and Body sensitivities that are the support for Cittas. The
Eye-base and Ear-base are useful for matters helpful for purification
such as seeing the Buddha and listening to Dhamma. The three bases
starting with the Nose are useful only for the enjoyment of sense
pleasures and nothing else. Due to the power of meditation on dispassion
towards sense pleasures, the three bases starting with the Nose do not
arise in Brahmas born there. The Eye and Ear bases arise for the purpose
of seeing the Buddha, listening to Dhamma, etc.</p>
<p>There are three parts of Cittas: Cittas arising dependent on a base,
Cittas arising either dependent on or not dependent on a base, and
Cittas arising without depending on a base.</p>
<p>The two Eye-consciousnesses arise dependent on the Eye-base. Ear,
Nose, Tongue, and Body consciousnesses also arise dependent on those
respective bases.</p>
<p>Thirty-three Cittas arise dependent on the Heart-base: Five-door
Adverting, two Receiving, three Investigating, eight Great Resultants,
two Hatred-Rooted Cittas, Stream-Entry Path Consciousness,
Smile-producing Citta, and fifteen Fine-material-sphere Cittas.</p>
<p>Forty-two Cittas arise dependent on the Heart-base material when
arising in the Sense and Fine-Material worlds, and arise without
depending on a base when arising in the Immaterial world: eight
Sense-Sphere Wholesome Cittas, four Immaterial Wholesome Cittas, eight
Greed-Rooted Cittas, two Delusion-Rooted Cittas, Mind-door Adverting,
eight Great Functional Cittas, four Immaterial Functional Cittas, and
seven Supramundane Cittas excluding the First Path.</p>
<p>The four Immaterial Resultant Cittas arise without depending on a
base.</p>
<p><strong>Part II</strong></p>
<p>There are forty-three Cittas arising dependent on a base. There are
forty-two Cittas arising either dependent on or not dependent on a base.
There are four Cittas arising without depending on a base.</p>
<p>Forty-three Cittas arise dependent on a base because those Cittas do
not arise in the Immaterial world.</p>
<p>Of those Cittas, the ten Dvipañca Viññāṇas, Five-door Adverting,
Receiving, Investigating, and Great Resultants do not arise in the
Immaterial world because the doors where they arise and the functions
performed by those Cittas do not exist there.</p>
<p>Hatred-Rooted Cittas do not arise there because those Cittas do not
arise in those who have obtained Jhānas.</p>
<p>The Smile-producing Citta does not exist there because Immaterial
beings do not smile.</p>
<p>The Stream-Entry Path Consciousness does not arise there because
Immaterial beings, lacking ears, cannot listen to Dhamma from others.
Except for Supreme Buddhas and Pacceka Buddhas, others cannot generate
the Stream-Entry Path by their own power without listening to Dhamma
from others. Buddhas and Pacceka Buddhas are not born in the Immaterial
World. There is no way for Immaterial beings to hear anything from
others. A person who has become a Stream-Enterer can attain the
remaining paths and fruits without the help of others. Sometimes those
who became Stream-Enterers in Sense and Fine-Material worlds are born in
the Immaterial world. They attain Once-Returning, Non-Returning, and
Arahant paths and fruits there and attain Parinibbāna.</p>

<h2 id="cognitive-processes-citta-vīthi">1. Cognitive Processes (Citta
Vīthi)</h2>
<p>Knowing correctly what meets the eye, knowing correctly sounds coming
to the ear, knowing correctly smells, tastes, and touches coming to the
nose, tongue, and body, speaking a word by oneself, knowing the meaning
of a word spoken by another, raising body parts, lowering them, moving
them here and there, going, coming, giving, taking—not one of these
matters occurs with a single Citta. For each of these matters to occur,
a series of Cittas must arise systematically. The mental continuities,
the streams of Cittas arising as the performance of those respective
matters, are called “<strong>Cognitive Processes</strong>” (<em>Citta
Vīthi</em>). Briefly, the streams of Cittas arising regarding each
matter should be called Citta Vīthi.</p>
<p>The mind is very subtle. It is also not something visible to the eye.
Wind, cold, and heat are felt by the body even though not visible to the
eye. The mind is not something felt or caught by the body in that way.
Being something that arises and breaks up very quickly, the mind is also
not something that can be caught for examination. Because of these
reasons, finding the nature of the mind is extremely difficult. What
makes knowing the nature of the mind most difficult is that the
instrument for knowing it is the mind itself. Another thing can be cut
with the instrument of cutting, the knife. That knife itself cannot be
cut by it. Similarly, the mind, which is the instrument of knowing,
cannot know the nature of that mind. Therefore, ordinary people who have
not studied the mind do not even know that there is something called a
Cognitive Process. Even for people who study and inquire about the mind,
knowledge about the mind arises inferentially as “these must be like
this,” but direct knowledge like seeing with the eye does not arise
about the mind. Since knowing about the mind is very useful, try to gain
knowledge even inferentially.</p>

<li>The Lifespan of Ultimate Realities - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-lifespan-of-ultimate-realities">2. The Lifespan of Ultimate
Realities</h2>
<p>What the person learning Cognitive Processes must do first is to know
the lifespan of Cittas and Rūpas. There are three stages for Cittas and
Rūpas: the time of arising, the time of existing, and the time of
perishing. Since these times are very short, the name
“<strong>Moment</strong>” (<em>Khaṇa</em>) is used for them. The arising
time is called <strong>Arising Moment</strong> (<em>Uppāda Khaṇa</em>),
the existing time is called <strong>Static Moment</strong> (<em>Ṭhiti
Khaṇa</em>), and the perishing time is called <strong>Dissolution
Moment</strong> (<em>Bhaṅga Khaṇa</em>). Adding the three times—Arising,
Static, Dissolution—belonging to a Citta, the name
“<strong>Mind-Moment</strong>” (<em>Cittakkhaṇa</em>) is used for it.
The meaning of Mind-Moment is the time of a Citta. If a Citta arises in
a certain amount of time, it exists for that same amount of time and
ceases in that same amount of time. There is no difference in the
duration of those three times. That Mind-Moment is a very short time. It
is a time not even a hundred-thousandth part of the time taken to blink
an eye. It may take you some time to understand this.</p>
<p>A Rūpa has a lifespan of seventeen Mind-Moments. That is fifty-one
minor moments (<em>khaṇa</em>). Of that, the first moment is the Arising
Moment of the Rūpa. The fifty-first moment is the Dissolution Moment of
the Rūpa. The middle forty-nine moments are the Static Moment of the
Rūpa. Unlike in Citta, the three moments Arising etc. of Rūpa are not
equal. The Static Moment of Rūpa is long. There are also several Rūpas
that do not have a lifespan of seventeen Mind-Moments. They are
secondary Rūpas.</p>
<p>For you who see objects remaining full before us for months and
years, saying “the lifespan of a Rūpa is seventeen Mind-Moments” may be
an unbelievable fact. To make it understandable, an explanation about
Rūpa will be given.</p>
<p>A pile of sand appearing to us as one thing when viewed from afar is
not one thing, but a collection of sand grains. All objects appearing to
us as single things are, like the pile of sand, collections of small
objects. Even the mustard seed considered as a very small thing is not
one thing but a collection of small material substances. All objects
visible to us are made of Material Groups (<em>Rūpa Kalāpa</em>). You
will know about Rūpa Kalāpa in the Matter Chapter. Rūpa Kalāpa is the
root of all objects. It is not something existing for a long time. Its
maximum lifespan is seventeen Mind-Moments. The time taken to blink an
eye is sufficient for thousands of Rūpa Kalāpas to arise and perish one
after another. In an object the size of a mustard seed, there are crores
of Rūpa Kalāpas. Know that a mustard seed is not one thing but a
collection of crores of Rūpa Kalāpas. Although the Rūpa Kalāpas in the
objects visible to us vanish in seventeen Mind-Moments, no change is
seen in those objects due to two reasons. Namely: one reason is that all
Rūpa Kalāpas in one object do not break at once. One reason is that new
Rūpa Kalāpas appear in those very places replacing the breaking Rūpa
Kalāpas.</p>
<p>In an object the size of a mustard seed also, there are lakhs of Rūpa
Kalāpas that have reached the second moment of the fifty-one minor
moments which is the full lifespan of a Rūpa. Similarly, there are lakhs
of Rūpa Kalāpas that have reached the third moment. Similarly, there are
lakhs of Rūpa Kalāpas that have reached all moments up to the fiftieth
moment. Every Rūpa Kalāpa breaks at the fifty-first moment. When Rūpas
break upon reaching the fifty-first moment, all Rūpa Kalāpas that have
reached the moments from the second moment to the forty-ninth moment
remain. Therefore, due to Rūpas breaking and breaking in seventeen
Mind-Moments, no change visible to us occurs in the objects. This fact
should be understood well.</p>
<p>Cognitive Processes do not arise at once regarding all Rūpas of
various ages in one object. Cognitive Processes arise taking as object a
group of Rūpas of equal age in one object.</p>

<li>Classification of Objects - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="classification-of-objects">3. Classification of Objects</h2>
<p>The objects coming to the five doors are of four kinds: “<strong>Very
Great Object</strong> (<em>Atimahantārammaṇa</em>), <strong>Great
Object</strong> (<em>Mahantārammaṇa</em>), <strong>Slight
Object</strong> (<em>Parittārammaṇa</em>), and <strong>Very Slight
Object</strong> (<em>Atiparittārammaṇa</em>).” Objects coming to the
Mind-door are of two parts: <strong>Clear Object</strong>
(<em>Vibhūtārammaṇa</em>) and <strong>Obscure Object</strong>
(<em>Avibhūtārammaṇa</em>). Thus, objects coming to the six doors are of
six kinds.</p>
<p>An object that is very apparent due to largeness, or due to light
being good, or due to being near, is called <strong>Very Great</strong>.
An object not as apparent as the Very Great Object is called
<strong>Great</strong>. An object not as apparent as the Great Object is
called <strong>Slight</strong>. An unapparent object is called
<strong>Very Slight</strong>.</p>
<p>A Rūpa does not impinge on the doors in its Arising Moment. It is the
Rūpa that has reached the Static stage that impinges on doors. The
object that impinges on the doors in the second Mind-Moment after
arising and passing one Mind-Moment (three minor moments) is the Very
Great Object. The object that impinges on the doors after passing two or
three Mind-Moments is called Great. The objects that impinge on the door
after passing four, five, six, seven, eight, nine Mind-Moments are
called Slight. The object that impinges on the door after passing ten to
fifteen Mind-Moments is called Very Slight.</p>
<p>In the Very Great Object, many Vīthi Cittas arise. In the Great
Object, a lesser number, and in the Slight Object, an even lesser number
of Vīthi Cittas arise. In the Very Slight Object, only vibration of the
Bhavanga occurs. Vīthi Cittas do not arise.</p>
<p><strong>Vīthi (Processes)</strong></p>
<p>Vīthis are of two parts: Five-door Processes and Mind-door Processes.
Five-door Processes are also of five parts: Eye-door Process, Ear-door
Process, Nose-door Process, Tongue-door Process, and Body-door Process.
Eye-door Processes are also of four parts: Very Great Object Process,
Great Object Process, Slight Object Process, and Very Slight Object
Process. In the Eye-door, there is one Very Great Object Process. There
are two Great Object Processes. There are six Slight Object Processes.
There are six Very Slight Object Processes. Total is fifteen. Ear, Nose,
Tongue, and Body door processes are also fifteen each. All Five-door
Processes are seventy-five.</p>
<p><strong>The Root Consciousness</strong></p>
<p>To a being at the moment of death, a kamma he did is remembered, or a
sign of kamma or a sign of destiny appears. Taking the thing that
appeared to the mind at the moment of death as object, the first Citta
of the next life arises. It is called “<strong>Rebirth-Linking
Consciousness</strong>” (<em>Paṭisandhi Citta</em>). According to
natural law, even after that Rebirth-Linking Consciousness ceases, a
consciousness similar to the Rebirth-Linking Consciousness arises again
and again until death in that continuity, taking the object that was the
object of the death-proximate consciousness. It is because of that
stream of consciousness that the stream of consciousness does not cut
off and the being lives. Since they are the cause for the existence of
the life (<em>Bhava</em>), those Cittas are called
“<strong>Life-Continuum (Bhavanga) Cittas</strong>.” Although the
Bhavanga Consciousness arises in beings at all times when no other Citta
exists, we do not feel that such a Citta is arising. That Bhavanga
Consciousness is the root consciousness of the being. Vīthis taking new
objects appear at the end of the stream of Bhavanga Cittas.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="the-very-great-object-process-at-the-eye-door">4. The Very Great
Object Process at the Eye-Door</h2>
<p>If a visible form (<em>Rūpa</em>) that has arisen and passed one
Mind-Moment impinges on the Eye-sensitivity (<em>Cakkhu Pasāda</em>),
immediately it impinges on the Bhavanga Consciousness existing in the
Heart-base as well. Thereby, a certain change occurs in the Bhavanga
Consciousness.</p>
<p>It is like a shaking. Therefore, it is called “<strong>Vibration of
the Bhavanga</strong>” (<em>Bhavanga Calana</em>). After that Bhavanga
Consciousness ceases, the Bhavanga Consciousness arising immediately
after it also arises and ceases in a shaking manner receiving the impact
of the Form Object. After that, the arising of Bhavanga Cittas stops,
and the <strong>Five-door Adverting</strong>
(<em>Pañcadvārāvajjana</em>) Consciousness arises contemplating the
impinged Form Object and ceases. Immediately after that, the
<strong>Eye-Consciousness</strong> (<em>Cakkhu Viññāṇa</em>) seeing that
form arises and ceases. Then, the <strong>Receiving</strong>
(<em>Sampaṭicchana</em>) Consciousness receiving that Form Object, the
<strong>Investigating</strong> (<em>Santīraṇa</em>) Consciousness
examining the nature of the Form Object, and the
<strong>Determining</strong> (<em>Votthapana</em>) Consciousness
determining the nature of the Form Object arise and cease in order.</p>
<p>Immediately after that, taking that Form Object as object as
determined by the Determining Consciousness, any one of the twenty-nine
Sense-Sphere Javanas arises seven times performing the Javana function
and ceases. Subsequently, any one of the eleven Registration
(<em>Tadālambana</em>) Cittas arises twice taking that Form Object as
taken by the Javana Consciousness and ceases. When the second
Registration Consciousness ceases, the Form Object that impinged on the
Eye-sensitivity also ceases as its lifespan of seventeen Mind-Moments is
exhausted. After that, Bhavanga Cittas start arising again as usual. The
fourteen Cittas arising in order from the Five-door Adverting
Consciousness to the second Registration Consciousness taking the form
impinged on the Eye-sensitivity as object is the <strong>Very Great
Object Process at the Eye-Door</strong>.</p>
<p>In showing Five-door Processes and Mind-door Processes arising taking
present forms as object, the order of Cittas arisen starting from the
place where those forms arose should be shown. The stated Very Great
Object Process arises due to the form that has arisen and passed a time
of one Mind-Moment impinging on the sensitivity. In the short time
passed before the Form Object arose and impinged on the sensitivity, a
Bhavanga Consciousness arose in the continuity of the person in whom
this process arose. But the said Form Object did not impinge on it. That
Bhavanga Consciousness which passed without receiving the impact of the
Form Object is known by the name <strong>Past Bhavanga</strong>
(<em>Atīta Bhavanga</em>). The Bhavanga Consciousness that arose as if
shaking due to the impact of the Form Object is known by the name
<strong>Vibrating Bhavanga</strong> (<em>Bhavanga Calana</em>). The
Bhavanga Consciousness arising immediately after it receiving the impact
of the Form Object cuts off the Bhavanga stream, so that Citta is named
<strong>Arrest Bhavanga</strong> (<em>Bhavangupaccheda</em>). Including
those, the process should be stated as follows. Memorize this to make
learning the process easier for you.</p>
<p><strong>Past Bhavanga, Vibrating Bhavanga, Arrest Bhavanga, Five-door
Adverting, Eye-Consciousness, Receiving, Investigating, Determining,
seven Javanas, two Registrations</strong>—this order of Cittas is called
the <strong>Very Great Object Process at the Eye-Door</strong>.</p>

<p>Vīthi charts are useful to easily keep Cognitive Processes in mind.
In charting Vīthis, three dots are used to indicate the three moments:
Arising (<em>Uppāda</em>), Static (<em>Ṭhiti</em>), and Dissolution
(<em>Bhaṅga</em>) of the Citta. Above or below those dots, the names of
the Cittas are marked with single letters. The letters used to identify
Cittas are as follows:</p>
<p>Past Bhavanga - <strong>Tī</strong> (Atīta Bhavanga) Vibrating
Bhavanga - <strong>Na</strong> (Bhavanga Calana) Arrest Bhavanga -

13 14 15 16 17</p>
<p>The numbers up to 17 below this are to indicate the seventeen
Mind-Moments which is the lifespan of Rūpa. In this chart, the three
Cittas with numbers 1, 2, 3 are all Bhavanga Cittas. They do not take
the form impinged on the sensitivity as object. Everywhere, the object
of Bhavanga Cittas is one of Kamma, Kamma Sign, or Destiny Sign. The
Bhavanga Consciousness shown above number 1 represents the Citta arisen
in the continuity of the person in whom the process arises at the moment
the form impinging on the sensitivity arises. The Form Object which has
arisen and passed one Mind-Moment impinged on the sensitivity at the
Arising Moment of the Vibrating Bhavanga. The first Citta arising taking
that form as object is the Five-door Adverting. The fourteen Cittas from
Five-door Adverting to the second Registration are Cittas arising taking
the form impinged on the sensitivity as object.</p>
<p>Of those fourteen Cittas, what is done by Five-door Adverting is
turning the stream of consciousness towards the Form Object impinged on
the sensitivity. What sees the form is Eye-Consciousness. Since
Eye-Consciousness ceases after seeing just the color, knowledge about
the form impinged on the sensitivity is not complete just by its
arising. To complete it, as soon as Eye-Consciousness ceases, Receiving
arises taking the Form Object seen by it. As soon as Receiving ceases,
Investigating arises as examining the Form Object by it. As soon as
Investigating ceases, the Determining Consciousness arises judging
according to that examination. After Determining ceases, the Javana
Consciousness arises seven times taking the nature of the Form Object
well as judged by it. The Citta that takes the object best is the
Javana. Since the Form Object exists impinging on the Eye-sensitivity
even after the cessation of the seventh Javana, two Registration Cittas
arise taking that object as taken by the Javana. Seeing the form is
completed by the Javana Consciousness. Registration is not such a useful
Citta. It is a Citta arising for Sense-Sphere beings, not for beings in
Fine-Material and Immaterial worlds. Since seeing forms etc. happens
without deficiency for Brahmas even without Registration, understand
that there is not much work done by Registration.</p>
<p>In this process, the Five-door Adverting etc. Cittas arising and
ceasing performing their respective function do not know anything other
than performing that respective function. To make this process clear, a
mango simile has been shown. It is as follows:</p>
<p>A man sleeps under a mango tree with fruit. A ripe mango falls near
his ear. He wakes up by its sound. He opens his eyes and looks. He takes
the mango into his hand. He squeezes the mango to see if it is ripe. He
smells it again to decide if it is ripe. Then he eats it. He swallows
the remaining part smeared in the mouth with saliva. Doing all that, he
sleeps again as before.</p>
<p>In this simile, the man sleeping should be understood as the time
when Bhavanga Cittas were arising. The falling of the mango should be
understood as the Form Object impinging on the Eye-sensitivity. The man
waking up should be understood as the Adverting Consciousness. Opening
eyes and looking as Eye-Consciousness. Taking the mango into the hand as
Receiving. Squeezing the hand to know if it is ripe as Investigating.
Smelling to decide ripeness as Determining Consciousness. Eating the
mango as Javana Consciousness. Swallowing the remainder smeared in the
mouth with saliva as Registration. Sleeping again as the arising of
Bhavanga again.</p>

<li>How Cognitive Processes Arise - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-cognitive-processes-arise">6. How Cognitive Processes
Arise</h2>
<p>The streams of Cittas such as Five-door Adverting, Eye-Consciousness
etc. arising regarding seeing forms etc., known by the name Cognitive
Processes (Citta Vīthi), cannot be generated by respective individuals
through their own effort. Nor can they be generated by the power of
anyone like a god. If an Eye-door Process arises, it arises solely
through the impinging of a Form Object on the Eye-sensitivity. Just as a
sound arises if a hand strikes the drum face, and fire arises if a match
is rubbed on the matchbox, Eye-door Processes arise if a collision
occurs between Eye-sensitivity and Form Object.</p>
<p>There is no organizer to command the series of Cittas starting with
Five-door Adverting to arise in the order of Five-door Adverting -
Eye-Consciousness - Receiving - Investigating etc. without confusion
when a form impinges on the Eye-sensitivity. Without such, these Cittas
arise in order solely by the power of preceding Cittas. Because
Five-door Adverting arises, Eye-Consciousness, which is suitable to
arise next to it, arises. Because Eye-Consciousness arises, Receiving,
the Citta suitable to arise next to it, arises. Because of the arising
of Receiving etc., Investigating etc. also arise systematically.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed Laws (Niyāma Dhamma)</strong></p>
<p>To show that Cittas can arise systematically even without an
organizer, ancient teachers have presented the discourse on Fixed Laws
(<em>Niyāma Dhamma</em>).</p>
<p>That is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Seed Law (Bīja Niyāma), Season Law (Utu Niyāma), Kamma Law
(Kamma Niyāma), Dhamma Law (Dhamma Niyāma), Mind Law (Citta
Niyāma)</strong> are five Fixed Laws.</p>
<p>From a mango seed, a cashew plant, lime plant, or orange plant does
not arise, but only a mango plant arises; from a jackfruit seed only a
jackfruit plant, from a coconut only a coconut plant, etc.—trees of
respective species arising from respective seeds; the top of the
chickpea plant turning towards the north; the top of the sunflower
turning towards the sun; the coconut having three eyes, etc., is
<strong>Seed Law</strong>.</p>
<p>Trees and creepers belonging to respective species bearing shoots,
flowers, and fruits at the same time is <strong>Season Law</strong>.</p>
<p>Only a result suitable to respective kammas arising is <strong>Kamma
Law</strong>.</p>
<p>Earthquakes and other signs appearing at the conception, birth,
enlightenment, and first sermon of Great Bodhisattvas is <strong>Dhamma
Law</strong>.</p>
<p>When objects like forms impinge on sensitivities like the eye, the
stream of Cittas arising systematically without anyone’s organization is
<strong>Mind Law</strong>.</p>
<p>The said five matters happen according to Fixed Laws without anyone’s
organization.</p>
<p>There is a convention in the country that “learning Cognitive
Processes is a difficult task.” What is difficult is to learn one
process first. If one resolves all questions regarding it and
understands one process well, one will be able to learn Cognitive
Processes without difficulty in the future. Therefore, learn this Very
Great Object Process very well without rushing to proceed. Understand it
well.</p>

<li>The Two Great Object Processes - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-two-great-object-processes">7. The Two Great Object
Processes</h2>
<p>The Very Great Object Process arises due to the object impinging on
the sensitivity in the second Mind-Moment, passing the time of one
Mind-Moment after arising. Sometimes, due to the Form Object being
small, or being far though large, or light being scarce, the Form Object
impinges on the sensitivity in the third Mind-Moment passing two
Mind-Moments after arising, or in the fourth Mind-Moment passing three
Mind-Moments. Regarding forms impinging on the sensitivity in the third
and fourth Mind-Moments, two Great Object Processes arise.</p>
<p>The first Great Object Process is as follows: When the Form Object
impinges on the Eye-sensitivity in the third Mind-Moment passing two
Mind-Moments after arising, as before, Vibrating Bhavanga - Arrest
Bhavanga - Five-door Adverting - Eye-Consciousness - Receiving -
Investigating - Determining Cittas arise in order, and then any one of
the Sense-Sphere Javanas arises seven times performing the Javana
function. After that, without Registration occurring as in the Very
Great Object Process, Bhavanga Cittas arise. This is the <strong>First
Great Object Process</strong>.</p>
<p>This process has twelve Vīthi Cittas from Five-door Adverting to the
seventh Javana. When the four Cittas: two Past Bhavangas arising before
the Form Object impinged on the sensitivity, and two Vibrating Bhavanga
- Arrest Bhavanga are added to the twelve Vīthi Cittas, there are
sixteen Cittas. Since the form that became the object of the process
started at the Arising Moment of the first Past Bhavanga, that form has
a lifespan of only one Mind-Moment after the seventh Javana. Being very
close to cessation, the form that has reached the last Mind-Moment is
very weak. That weak Form Object is not capable of being a condition for
a Registration. Therefore, a Registration does not arise in this
process. There are various teachers’ opinions regarding the arising of
Registration. Since they are troublesome for beginners, they are not
presented here.</p>
<p>The second Great Object Process is as follows: The process where a
Form Object that has passed three Mind-Moments after arising impinges on
the Eye-sensitivity in the fourth Mind-Moment, and after the arising of
Vibrating Bhavanga - Arrest Bhavanga - Five-door Adverting -
Eye-Consciousness - Receiving - Investigating - Determining Cittas,
Javana arises seven times, is the <strong>Second Great Object
Process</strong>. With the seventh Javana of this process, the Form
Object that was the object of the process ceases.</p>

<p><strong>The Six Slight Object Processes</strong></p>
<p>The six processes arising taking as object: the Form Object impinging
on the Eye-sensitivity in the fifth Mind-Moment passing four
Mind-Moments after arising; the Form Object impinging on the sensitivity
in the sixth Mind-Moment passing five Mind-Moments; the Form Object
impinging on the sensitivity in the seventh Mind-Moment passing six
Mind-Moments; the Form Object impinging on the sensitivity in the eighth
Mind-Moment passing seven Mind-Moments; the Form Object impinging on the
sensitivity in the ninth Mind-Moment passing eight Mind-Moments; and the
form impinging on the sensitivity in the tenth Mind-Moment passing nine
Mind-Moments, are called <strong>Slight Object Processes</strong>.</p>
<p>The difference in Great Object Processes is the absence of a
Registration. The difference in Slight Object Processes is the absence
of both Javana and Registration.</p>
<p>When a Form Object impinges on the Eye-sensitivity in the fifth
Mind-Moment passing four Mind-Moments after arising, Vibrating Bhavanga
- Arrest Bhavanga - Five-door Adverting - Eye-Consciousness - Receiving
- Investigating - Determining Cittas arise in order. When counting those
Cittas from Vibrating Bhavanga, the Determining Consciousness is the
seventh Citta. When counting adding four Past Bhavangas that passed
before impinging on the sensitivity to the beginning, the Determining
Consciousness is the eleventh Citta. The form that became the object of
this process arose with the first Past Bhavanga. Therefore, when
Determining ceases, the lifespan of that form is eleven Mind-Moments.
There are only six Mind-Moments left to complete seventeen. Six
Mind-Moments after Determining, the form that became the object of the
process ceases.</p>
<p>The Mind Law is that Sense-Sphere Javana arises seven times when
there is no special reason for the reduction of the number of Javana
Citta turns arising. Therefore, Javana Cittas do not arise in an object
where there is no room for Javana Consciousness to arise seven times.
For the aforementioned Form Object, there is only a time of six
Mind-Moments remaining. Since time is insufficient for Javana to arise
seven times, a Javana Consciousness does not arise in that Slight
Object. In the Javana places, instead of Javana, the Determining
Consciousness itself arises once or twice. After that, Bhavanga descent
occurs.</p>
<p>Here the question arises: “Why can’t a seventh Javana arise after the
Form Object ceases with the sixth Javana Consciousness?” The object of
Cittas belonging to one process must be the same not only by Dhamma but
also by time. The form that becomes the object of this process, having
spent the lifespan of seventeen Mind-Moments, after ceasing in the
seventeenth Mind-Moment belonging to the present time, belongs to the
past time. If a Javana arises in this process after the form ceases,
since there is no present form to objectify, it has to objectify the
past form. Since that is contrary to Mind Law, in this Slight Object
where there is no room for Javana Consciousness to arise seven times
taking the present form as object, Javana does not arise at all. There,
after Determining, instead of Javana, Determining itself arises once or
twice more. Before the form ceases, Bhavanga descent occurs and the
process ends.</p>

<h2 id="the-six-slight-object-processes">8. The Six Slight Object
Processes</h2>
<p>(Note: The source title says “Slight Object Processes” but the
content describes “Very Slight Object Processes” - Atiparittārammaṇa. I
will translate according to the content.)</p>
<p><strong>The Six Very Slight Object Processes</strong></p>
<p>By the Form Object impinging on the Eye-sensitivity after passing
ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen Mind-Moments after
arising, the six <strong>Very Slight Object Processes</strong>
arise.</p>
<p>If Vīthi Cittas arise regarding an object impinging on the
sensitivity after passing ten Mind-Moments after arising, only Cittas up
to Determining get to arise before that object ceases. There is no time
for another Determining to arise in the Javana place instead of Javana.
Since that object is very weak, Five-door Adverting etc. Vīthi Cittas do
not arise there either. By the impinging of that object, only the
vibration of the Bhavanga occurs. Objects impinging on the sensitivity
after passing more than ten Mind-Moments also cause Bhavanga vibration.
That is why there are six Very Slight Object Processes.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Ear-door Processes etc.</strong></p>
<p>By the Sound Object which has passed one Mind-Moment after arising
impinging on the Ear-sensitivity, the Ear-door Very Great Object Process
arises. The only difference from the Eye-door Very Great Object Process
is the arising of Ear-Consciousness instead of Eye-Consciousness. All
fifteen Ear-door Processes should be understood according to Eye-door
Processes. The difference in Nose, Tongue, and Body door processes is
also only the arising of Nose, Tongue, and Body consciousnesses after
Five-door Adverting. Total Five-door Processes are seventy-five.</p>
<p>Objects like form and sound are felt very well by Cittas of Very
Great Object Processes. Objects are felt well by Cittas of Great Object
Processes. Objects are not felt well by Slight Object Processes since a
Javana Consciousness does not arise. The knowing occurring by them is
very weak. If a Slight Object Process arises regarding a Form Object, a
weak knowing arises as if seen in a dream, as if seen and not seen. When
Slight Object Processes arise regarding a Sound Object too, a weak
knowing arises as if heard and not heard. The knowing of other objects
is similar. Since Vīthi Cittas do not arise in the Very Slight Object, a
knowledge regarding that object does not arise at all. There is no use
at all from those processes.</p>
<p><strong>Mind Law (Citta Niyāma)</strong></p>
<p>Fine-material-sphere, Immaterial-sphere, and Supramundane Cittas do
not arise in these Five-door Processes. In Eye-door Processes, the
forty-six Cittas mentioned as Eye-door Cittas in the Compendium of Doors
are obtained. The number of Cittas obtained in Ear-door Processes etc.
should also be stated exactly as shown in the Compendium of Doors. In
Five-door Processes, in every way, only the fifty-four Sense-Sphere
Cittas are obtained.</p>
<p>The Five-door Adverting found in these processes is a Functional
Citta. The Five Consciousnesses, Receiving, and Investigating are
Resultants. Determining is a Functional Citta. Javana becomes Wholesome,
Unwholesome, or Functional. Registration are Resultants.</p>
<p>When desirable or good forms, sounds etc. impinge on sensitivities,
Wholesome Resultant Five Consciousnesses, Receiving, Investigating, and
Registration arise. When undesirable or bad forms, sounds etc. meet the
doors, Unwholesome Resultant Five Consciousnesses, Receiving,
Investigating, and Registration become. When the object is very good,
Investigating and Registration become Joy-Accompanied.</p>
<p>Even excrement, which is a very bad thing, some animals consider as
good. Some rich people consider even some good things as bad. Therefore,
deciding the goodness or badness of objects is difficult. It is stated
in the Commentary that their goodness or badness should be done
according to the consideration of average people.</p>
<p>Whatever the person’s idea about the object, Wholesome Resultant
Cittas arise in a good object. Similarly, Unwholesome Resultant Cittas
arise in a bad object. Kamma and Result do not go wrong just because
people have wrong ideas. Therefore, for heretics who consider even the
Buddha’s body as an unsuitable, improper object to see, upon seeing the
Buddha, only Wholesome Resultant Eye-Consciousness, Receiving,
Investigating, and Registration occur. For the being who likes excrement
which is a bad thing, upon seeing excrement, Unwholesome Resultant
Eye-Consciousness, Receiving, Investigating, and Registration arise.</p>
<p>Javana is something that arises according to the ideas of
individuals. For those with wholesome disposition who like wholesome
deeds, Wholesome Javanas can arise in all good, bad, and neutral
objects. For those who live attached to sin, away from Dhamma and devoid
of wise attention (<em>yoniso manasikāra</em>), Unwholesome Javanas can
arise in all objects. In the processes of Arahants, Functional Javanas
arise.</p>
<p>Of the Cittas belonging to the Eye-door Process, only
Eye-Consciousness arises in the Eye-base. Other Cittas arise in the
Heart-base. However, since all of them arise solely due to the Form
Object impinging on the Eye-sensitivity, the complete process is
considered as an Eye-door Process. Ear-door Processes etc. should also
be understood in that manner.</p>

<li>Mind-Door Processes - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mind-door-processes">9. Mind-Door Processes</h2>
<p>There are two parts of Mind-door Processes: Sense-Sphere Javana
Process and Absorption (<em>Appanā</em>) Javana Process. ‘Absorption
Javana’ refers to Sublime and Supramundane Javanas. There are five
<strong>Clear Object</strong> (<em>Vibhūtārammaṇa</em>) Processes
arising taking a present form with a lifespan of seventeen Mind-Moments
as object. There are two <strong>Obscure Object</strong>
(<em>Avibhūtārammaṇa</em>) Processes arising taking them as object. In
the twenty-eight Rūpas, there are twenty-two Rūpas with a lifespan of
seventeen Mind-Moments each. The other six Rūpas do not have that much
lifespan. You will know about Rūpa in the Matter Chapter. There is one
Clear Object Process and one Obscure Object Process arising taking the
remaining Name-and-Matter Dhammas that do not have a lifespan of
seventeen Mind-Moments, and the twenty-two Rūpas with a lifespan of
seventeen Mind-Moments belonging to Past and Future. Thus, there are
nine Sense-Sphere Javana Mind-door Processes.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Object Processes with Seventeen
Mind-Moments</strong></p>
<p><strong>1st Clear Object Process</strong></p>
<p>When a form with a lifespan of seventeen Mind-Moments meets the
Mind-door in the second Mind-Moment after arising and passing one
Mind-Moment, and after Vibrating Bhavanga, Arrest Bhavanga, and
Mind-door Adverting arise and cease, any one Sense-Sphere Javana arises
seven times and Registration arises twice—this is the First
Seventeen-Momented Clear Object Process. The form that is the object of
the process ceases with the fourth Bhavanga.</p>

<p>In these process charts, Past Bhavangas are shown to indicate the
number of Mind-Moments passed before the Form Object impinged on the
Mind-door. Bhavangas after Registration are shown to indicate the time
the form object of the Vīthi Cittas exists.</p>
<p><strong>Two Obscure Object Processes</strong></p>
<p>Objects impinging on the Mind-door after passing six or seven
Mind-Moments after arising are weak. They are obscure. Therefore, it is
called “<strong>Obscure Object</strong>” (<em>Avibhūtārammaṇa</em>).
Registration does not arise in the Obscure Object Process. At the end of
Javana, Bhavanga descent occurs.</p>

<p><strong>Clear Object Process Without Seventeen
Mind-Moments</strong></p>
<p>When any of these: Sense-Sphere Citta and Cetasikas which are
present, past, or future but do not have a lifespan of seventeen
Mind-Moments, the two Intimation Rūpas, the four Characteristic Rūpas,
or the twenty-two Seventeen-Momented Rūpas that are past or future,
meets the Mind-door, and after Vibrating Bhavanga, Arrest Bhavanga, and
Mind-door Adverting, any Sense-Sphere Javana arises seven times and
Registration arises twice, followed by Bhavanga, it is the Clear Object
Process Without Seventeen Mind-Moments.</p>

<p>When any of these: past, future, or present eighty-nine Cittas,
fifty-two Cetasikas, two Intimation Rūpas, four Characteristic Rūpas,
twenty-two past or future Rūpas without a lifespan of seventeen
Mind-Moments, or Time-freed Nibbāna and Concepts, meets the Mind-door,
and after Vibrating Bhavanga, Arrest Bhavanga, Mind-door Adverting, and
Sense Javana seven times arise, followed by Bhavanga without becoming
Registration, it is the Obscure Object Process Without Seventeen
Mind-Moments.</p>
<p><strong>Chart of Process</strong></p>
<p>Bha - Na - Da - Ma - Ja - Ja - Ja - Ja - Ja - Ja - Ja - Bha</p>
<p>Of these two processes, objects are few for the Clear Object Process
due to Registration. Registration is a weak Citta. It is stated in the
Compendium of Objects that it is a Citta taking only Sense-Sphere
Dhammas as object. It is also stated there what Sense-Sphere Dhammas
are. Except for Sense-Sphere Dhammas, nothing else can be an object for
a process where Registration arises.</p>
<p>Certain Sense-Sphere Javanas are capable of taking everything as
object. Therefore, objects are many for the Obscure Object Process which
is not Registration.</p>

<li>Occasions where Mind-Door Processes Arise - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="occasions-where-mind-door-processes-arise">10. Occasions where
Mind-Door Processes Arise</h2>
<p>To have a good understanding of Mind-door Processes, one must know
the occasions when they arise. It was stated above that
Seventeen-Momented Clear Object and Obscure Object Mind-door Processes
arise taking the twenty-two present Rūpas with a lifespan of seventeen
Mind-Moments as object. The five objects: Form, Sound, Smell, Taste, and
Tangible are included in those twenty-two Rūpas.</p>
<p>If you go to the Ruwanwelisaya, you see that Great Stupa. Seeing the
Ruwanwelisaya means nothing other than the arising of some Eye-door
Process in your continuity taking the Ruwanwelisaya as object.</p>
<p>When you go home, you remember the Ruwanwelisaya you saw. Remembering
that Ruwanwelisaya means the arising of a Mind-door Process taking the
Ruwanwelisaya you saw earlier as object.</p>
<p>The Ruwanwelisaya you saw is a group of Rūpas with a lifespan of
seventeen Mind-Moments. Spending the lifespan of seventeen Mind-Moments,
that group of Rūpas ceased immediately. Now they are not there. The
object of the Mind-door Process arising in your continuity as
remembering the seen Ruwanwelisaya is a group of past Rūpas that you saw
at that time and are not there now. What arose in you at that time was
one of the two Mind-door Processes without seventeen Mind-Moments taking
a past form as object.</p>
<p>If you turn towards the Ruwanwelisaya invisible to the eye from home
and worship it, what is subjected to that worship is not the
Ruwanwelisaya you saw earlier, but the Ruwanwelisaya existing there at
that time. As worshipping it, what arises in you is some process from
the five Seventeen-Momented Clear Object Processes and two Obscure
Object Processes taking the present form as object. It is said that the
worship is not directed to the previously seen Ruwanwelisaya because all
Rūpas seen earlier as Ruwanwelisaya have ceased.</p>
<p>When worshipping the Ruwanwelisaya from home, the group of Rūpa
Kalāpas that have passed one Mind-Moment after arising, which you
consider as Ruwanwelisaya, can also be directed to your Mind-door. Rūpa
Kalāpas of the Ruwanwelisaya that have passed two, three, four, five
Mind-Moments can also have approached your Mind-door. From them, the
first, second, third, fourth, fifth Clear Object Processes arise for
you. If Rūpas that have passed six or seven Mind-Moments are directed to
the Mind-door, then Obscure Object Processes arise.</p>
<p>If the Concept called Ruwanwelisaya is directed to the Mind-door,
then the Mind-door Process taking the Concept as object without
seventeen Mind-Moments arises.</p>
<p>If you remember that you saw the Ruwanwelisaya, then what arose in
you was a Mind-door Process taking the Eye-Consciousness or Eye-door
Process as object. It is a Mind-door Process arising taking Cittas as
object. Remembering the Ruwanwelisaya is one thing. Remembering that you
saw the Ruwanwelisaya is another. Understand the difference between the
two without confusion.</p>
<p>Perhaps great joy arose in you by seeing the Ruwanwelisaya. Joy is a
Cetasika. If you remember the joy that arose from seeing the
Ruwanwelisaya, then a Mind-door Process taking the Joy Cetasika as
object arises.</p>
<p>Feeling is also a Cetasika. If you remember a feeling you had, then a
Mind-door Process taking the Feeling Cetasika as object arises. If you
feel the pain of another when seeing someone suffering from pain, then
too a Mind-door Process taking the Feeling Cetasika as object arose.</p>
<p>When remembering love, anger, conceit, envy, loving-kindness,
compassion, etc., arising in your continuity, and when feeling those
matters arising in others, Mind-door Processes taking Cetasikas as
object arise.</p>
<p>What has been said so far are a few facts that can be easily
understood. Think according to the stated facts and understand how
Mind-door Processes arise taking Rūpa and Citta-Cetasikas as
objects.</p>

<li>Causes for the Arising of Mind-Door Processes - Abhidhamma
Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="causes-for-the-arising-of-mind-door-processes">11. Causes for
the Arising of Mind-Door Processes</h2>
<p>It is apparent that Five-door Processes arise from the impinging of
objects like forms on doors like the eye. The causes for the arising of
Mind-door Processes are unapparent. Therefore, they are shown.</p>
<p>There are many causes for the arising of Mind-door Processes. The
impinging of objects like forms on the five doors is also one cause for
the arising of Mind-door Processes. Being connected with objects taken
by the five doors, hearing others speak, being connected with what was
heard, being asked questions by others, thinking, disturbance of bodily
elements (<em>dhātu kopa</em>), hunger-thirst, arising of various bodily
pains, meeting enemies, meeting friends—these are part of the causes for
the arising of Mind-door Processes.</p>
<p>When a bell is struck once, a loud sound arises. Afterward, without
striking, a series of sounds arises gradually becoming thinner due to
the sound that arose first. Similarly, when a Form Object impinges on
the Eye-sensitivity once, even after an Eye-door Process arises and
ceases, due to that Form Object appearing at the Mind-door, sometimes
hundreds and thousands of Mind-door Processes arise. Similarly, after
Ear, Nose, Tongue, Body door processes, hundreds and thousands of
Mind-door Processes arise due to objects like sound being directed to
the Mind-door.</p>
<p>When the five doors take an object once, many Mind-door Processes
arise due to many objects connected with that object being directed to
the Mind-door by way of similarity.</p>
<p>Immeasurable Mind-door Processes arise by hearing what others say,
such as “There is such a thing at such a place,” “So-and-so did such a
thing,” “Such a thing happened at such a place in such a country.”
Immeasurable Mind-door Processes arise similarly due to reading
books.</p>
<p>Many Mind-door Processes arise due to many other facts being directed
to the Mind-door because of the connection with facts known by hearing
from others or reading books.</p>
<p>Many Mind-door Processes arise due to many facts connected with those
questions being directed to the Mind-door because of questions asked by
others.</p>
<p>“Thinking” is directing one’s mind towards unknown facts. Many
Mind-door Processes arise due to many objects being directed to the
Mind-door because of thinking.</p>
<p>It should be understood that many Mind-door Processes often arise due
to disturbance of elements etc. Also, various objects are sometimes
given to people’s minds by spirits. Know that many Mind-door Processes
arise because of that too.</p>
<p><strong>Consequent Mind-door Processes (Anubandhaka Manodvāra
Vīthi)</strong></p>
<p>Just because a form impinged on the Eye-sensitivity and an Eye-door
Process arose, the knowledge “I saw such a thing” does not arise in that
person. For the feeling “I saw such a thing” to arise, a number of
Mind-door Processes must also arise after the Eye-door Process. The
Eye-door Process only feels the color impinged on the Eye-sensitivity.
Just because Ear, Nose, Tongue, Body door processes arose, the person
does not feel “such a thing was heard,” “such a smell - such a taste -
was felt,” “such a thing was touched.” To have knowledge about them, a
number of Mind-door Processes must arise. Mind-door Processes arising
regarding objects taken by those processes after Five-door Processes are
called <strong>Consequent Mind-door Processes</strong>. What arise as
Consequent Mind-door Processes are also the Clear Object and Obscure
Object Processes without seventeen Mind-Moments mentioned above. The
method of arising of Consequent Mind-door Processes after Five-door
Processes is stated in several ways in several books.</p>
<p>When a form impinges on the Eye-sensitivity, first an Eye-door
Process arises. After it ceases, a Mind-door Process arises taking the
past form taken by the Eye-door Process. After that, a Mind-door Process
arises taking the name given to that form as object. After it ceases, a
Mind-door Process arises taking the thing identified by that name or the
meaning of the word. The knowledge “I saw such a thing” arises in the
person after the arising of the third Mind-door Process.</p>
<p>When a sound comes to the Ear-door, first an Ear-Consciousness
Process arises. After it ceases, a Mind-door Process arises taking the
past sound again. After it ceases, a Mind-door Process arises bringing
up its name. According to Nose, Tongue, Body door processes also, three
Mind-door Processes arise similarly. This is one teacher’s opinion.</p>
<p><strong>A Special Fact</strong></p>
<p>In many Abhidhamma books, Death-Proximate Processes and Absorption
Processes are shown in the fourth chapter itself. It is easier to learn
Death-Proximate Processes in the Tetrad of Death and Rebirth in the
fifth chapter. Good knowledge about Absorption Processes can be obtained
by learning them together with Meditation Subjects
(<em>Kammaṭṭhāna</em>). Therefore, we will present Death-Proximate
Processes and Absorption Processes in those very places.</p>

Great Resultants, the remaining sixty-four Vīthi Cittas are
obtained.</p>
<p>In the Immaterial Plane, forty-two Cittas are obtained: eight
Greed-Rooted Cittas, two Delusion-Rooted Cittas, Mind-door Adverting,
eight Great Wholesome, eight Great Functional, eight Immaterial-sphere
Wholesome and Functional, and seven Supramundane Cittas excluding the
First Path.</p>
<p>Not a single Citta is obtained in the Non-Percipient Plane.</p>
<p><strong>Brief Count:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In Sense Plane - 80</li>
<li>In Fine-Material Plane - 64</li>
<li>In Immaterial Plane - 42</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Sense-Sphere Plane, all Vīthi Cittas are obtained because all
six doors and all persons are obtained there. Certain Cittas are not
obtained in Fine-Material and Immaterial planes because the doors where
those Cittas arise do not exist there. Hatred-Rooted Cittas are not
obtained there because Hatred, being a Hindrance, is an obstacle to
Jhānas. Greed is also an obstacle to Jhānas. However, not every Greed
becomes a Hindrance and obstructs Jhānas. Therefore, Greed-Rooted Cittas
are obtained in Fine-Material and Immaterial planes. There is no Hatred
that is not a Hindrance. Therefore, Hatred-Rooted Cittas are completely
not obtained in Fine-Material and Immaterial planes.</p>
<p>Registration (<em>Tadālambana</em>) is also a group of Cittas
obtained only by Sense beings. They do not exist in Fine-Material and
Immaterial worlds. Therefore, Registration is not obtained in Very Great
Object Processes and Mind-door Clear Object Processes arising in those
planes.</p>

<li>The Tetrad of Planes - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-tetrad-of-planes">1. The Tetrad of Planes</h2>
<p>There are four planes: <strong>Woeful Plane (Apāya Bhūmi), Sense
Blissful Plane (Kāma Sugati Bhūmi), Fine-Material Plane (Rūpāvacara
Bhūmi), and Immaterial Plane (Arūpāvacara Bhūmi)</strong>. ‘Plane’
(<em>Bhūmi</em>) refers to the places where beings are born and
live.</p>
<p>There are four Woeful Planes: <strong>Hell (Naraka), Animal Realm
(Tiracchāna Yoni), Realm of Petas (Peta Visaya), and Host of Asuras
(Asura Nikāya)</strong>.</p>
<p>There are eight Great Hells: <strong>Sañjīva, Kālasūtra, Saṅghāta,
Raurava, Mahā Raurava, Tāpana, Mahā Tāpana, and Avīci</strong>. These
Great Hells are located inside the earth, one below the other. They are
square. Their floor and walls are made of iron. They are covered from
above by an iron sheet. The inside is filled with flames. Each hell has
four doors in the four directions. The size of the inside of a hell is
one hundred yojanas in each direction.</p>
<p>There are four small hells in each direction outside each Great Hell.
They are called “<strong>Osjpat Naraka</strong>” (<em>Ussada
Niraya</em>). There are sixteen <em>Ussada Nirayas</em> for one Great
Hell. There are 128 <em>Ussada Nirayas</em> in all eight Great Hells.
Names like Vetaraṇī Hell, Asipattravana Hell, Kukkula Hell, Gūtha Hell,
Simbalīvana Hell, Lohakumbhī Hell are used for the <em>Ussada
Nirayas</em> located around the Great Hells.</p>
<p>The group of Animal beings is very diverse.</p>
<p>Since there are many beings ranging from small creatures invisible to
the eye to very large animals, of various sizes, various shapes, and
various colors, the Animal Realm is very diverse. They do not have a
separate dwelling plane. The animal species itself is considered the
Animal Plane.</p>
<p>Sometimes the name <strong>Peta</strong> is used for dead people in
the sense of “those who have departed from this world.” In this
discussion of Apāya, the name Peta is used for a group of suffering
beings departed from happiness.</p>
<p>Those Petas, who are born spontaneously (<em>Opapātika</em>), are
born with various sizes, various shapes, and various colors according to
kamma. Therefore, the Peta group is also very diverse. They also do not
have a separate plane. The Peta species itself or the place where they
live is considered the Peta Plane.</p>
<p>It is shown that there are four kinds of Petas:
<strong>Paradattupajīvika, Khuppipāsika, Nijjhāmataṇhika, and
Kālakauñjika</strong>.</p>
<p>Those who live on what is given by others are
<em>Paradattupajīvika</em>. They receive food and drink etc. by
rejoicing in the merit given by others. Those born as
<em>Paradattupajīvika</em> Petas expect merit from relatives.</p>
<p><em>Khuppipāsika</em> is a group of Petas who constantly suffer from
hunger and thirst due to not receiving food and drink.</p>
<p><em>Nijjhāmataṇhika</em> is a group of Petas whose insides and
outsides are constantly burning.</p>
<p><em>Kālakauñjika</em> is said to be a group of Petas with little
blood and flesh, dried up, with bodies about three gavvas (a measure of
length) in size, with protruding eyes like crabs located on the top of
the head, with a very small mouth also located on the top of the head,
who eat with their heads down.</p>
<p>The name <strong>Asura</strong> is used for several groups of beings.
The beings belonging to the Asura Host, which is one of the four Woeful
Planes, are the <em>Kālakauñjika</em> Petas. They also do not have a
separate dwelling place.</p>
<p>There is a powerful group of beings living in the Asura realm at the
bottom of Mount Meru, using names like Vepacitti, Pahārada, Sambara,
Bali, etc. Since they are enemies of the Devas, they are also called
Asuras. They are not beings belonging to Apāya. They belong to a Deva
group. There is another group of beings called <em>Vinipātika
Asuras</em>. They are a group of beings who obtain food and drink
belonging to the Cātummahārājika Deva group with difficulty.
Piyankaramātā, Uttaramātā etc. belonged to the <em>Vinipātika Asura</em>
group. There is also a group called <em>Vemānika Peta Asuras</em>.
Beings in the Lokantarika Hell are also called Asuras.</p>
<p><strong>Sense Blissful Planes</strong></p>
<p>There are seven Sense Blissful Planes: <strong>Human Plane,
Cātummahārājika, Tāvatiṃsa, Yāma, Tusita, Nimmāṇarati, and
Paranimmitavasavatti</strong>. The four Woeful Planes, the Human World,
and the six Heavens—these eleven planes are <strong>Sense-Sphere
Planes</strong>.</p>

<li>Fine-Material and Immaterial Planes - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="fine-material-and-immaterial-planes">2. Fine-Material and
Immaterial Planes</h2>
<p>There are three <strong>First Jhāna Planes</strong>:
<strong>Brahmapārisajja, Brahmapurohita, and Mahābrahma</strong>.</p>
<p>There are three <strong>Second Jhāna Planes</strong>:
<strong>Parittābha, Appamāṇābha, and Ābhassara</strong>.</p>
<p>There are three <strong>Third Jhāna Planes</strong>:
<strong>Parittasubha, Appamāṇasubha, and Subhakiṇhaka</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Vehapphala, Asaññasatta, and Suddhāvāsa</strong> are the
<strong>Fourth Jhāna Planes</strong>.</p>
<p>There are five <strong>Suddhāvāsa (Pure Abodes) Planes</strong>:
<strong>Aviha, Atappa, Sudassa, Sudassī, and Akaniṭṭha</strong>. Thus
there are sixteen Fine-Material Planes.</p>
<p>There are four <strong>Immaterial Planes</strong>: <strong>Base of
Infinite Space, Base of Infinite Consciousness, Base of Nothingness, and
Base of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception</strong>.</p>
<p>Eleven Sense-Sphere Planes, sixteen Fine-Material Planes, and four
Immaterial Planes make thirty-one Planes.</p>
<p>Starting from the Human World, the Sense Blissful Planes are located
one above the other in order. Above Paranimmitavasavatti, the three
First Jhāna Planes are located on one level. Above them, the three
Second Jhāna Planes are on one level; above them, the three Third Jhāna
Planes are on one level; and above them, the two Fourth Jhāna Planes:
Vehapphala and Asaññasatta are located on one level. Above them, the
five Suddhāvāsa Planes are located one above the other. Above them, the
four Immaterial Planes are located in order.</p>
<p>Of the thirty-one planes, in the Asañña Plane there is only one
aggregate, the Materiality Aggregate. Therefore, it is called the
<strong>One-Constituent Plane (<em>Ekavokāra Bhūmi</em>)</strong>. In
the Immaterial Planes, there are only the four Mental Aggregates.
Therefore, they are called the <strong>Four-Constituent Plane
(<em>Catuvokāra Bhūmi</em>)</strong>. In the eleven Sense-Sphere Planes
and the fifteen Fine-Material Planes other than the Asañña Plane, all
five aggregates exist. They are called the <strong>Five-Constituent
Plane (<em>Pañcavokāra Bhūmi</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>Worldlings (Puthujjana) and Stream-Entry and Once-Returning
individuals do not exist in the Suddhāvāsa Planes. Noble Ones (Ariyas)
do not exist in the four Woeful Planes and the Asañña Plane. In other
planes, all individuals, both Noble and Worldling, exist.</p>
<p>In the four Woeful Planes, there is only the Woeful Rootless person.
In the Human Plane and Cātummahārājika, all eleven individuals except
the Woeful Rootless person are found. From Tāvatiṃsa to
Paranimmitavasavatti, ten individuals are found, excluding the Rootless
persons. In the Fine-Material Planes from Brahmapārisajja to Vehapphala,
nine persons are found: the Three-Rooted Worldling and the eight Noble
Persons. In the Asañña Plane, only the Blissful Rootless person is
found. In the Suddhāvāsa Planes, the three highest Noble Persons are
found. In the Immaterial Planes, eight persons are found: the
Three-Rooted Worldling and seven Noble Persons excluding the
Stream-Entry Path-stander. If the total number of individuals found in
respective planes is added up, there are two hundred and fourteen.</p>
<p>Laypeople in the human world also attain the paths and fruits of
Stream-Entry, Once-Returning, Non-Returning, and Arahantship. Laypeople
who become Arahants either ordain or attain Parinibbāna. They do not
remain as laypeople for long. Earth-bound Devas (<em>Bhummaṭṭha
Deva</em>), even if Arahant, live as such for their lifespan. In
Sense-Sphere Heavens, Non-Returners either go to the Brahma world or
attain Arahantship and Parinibbāna. There are no suitable places for
Non-Returners and Arahants to live in Heavens. In Fine-Material and
Immaterial Planes, all Noble Ones live as long as their lifespan lasts.
Stream-Entry and Once-Returning persons who reached Fine-Material Planes
do not return to the Sense World. Non-Returners who reached the three
planes: Vehapphala, Akaniṭṭha, and Nevasaññānāsaññāyatana do not go to
another place again. They become Arahants and attain Parinibbāna in
those very planes.</p>

<li>The Tetrad of Rebirth-Linking - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-tetrad-of-rebirth-linking">3. The Tetrad of
Rebirth-Linking</h2>
<p>There are four Rebirth-Linkings: <strong>Woeful Rebirth-Linking,
Sense Blissful Rebirth-Linking, Fine-Material Rebirth-Linking, and
Immaterial Rebirth-Linking</strong>.</p>
<p>Woeful Rebirth-Linking is one. That is: <strong>Unwholesome Resultant
Equanimity-Accompanied Investigating Consciousness</strong>. For a being
to whom an unwholesome kamma, or an unwholesome kamma sign, or a woeful
destiny sign appeared at the time of death, immediately upon the
cessation of the Death Consciousness (<em>Cuti Citta</em>) which is the
last Citta of the present existence, the Unwholesome Resultant
Equanimity-Accompanied Investigating Consciousness arises in the Woeful
Plane taking as object what appeared at the time of death. The arising
of that Citta is itself the birth of that being in Apāya. It is going to
Apāya. Since that Citta arises belonging to the very stream of
consciousness of the dying being immediately after the Death
Consciousness, connecting the past existence and the present Apāya
existence, it is called <strong>Rebirth-Linking Consciousness</strong>
(<em>Paṭisandhi Citta</em>). After that, for that being, that
Equanimity-Accompanied Investigating Consciousness arising at
Rebirth-Linking starts arising again and again so that the stream of
consciousness belonging to that Apāya existence does not get cut off.
When it arises so, it is called <strong>Life-Continuum (Bhavanga)
Consciousness</strong>. It is that same Citta that arises as the last
Citta of the existence. Thus, for beings born in the Woeful Plane, the
Unwholesome Resultant Equanimity-Accompanied Investigating Consciousness
exists as Rebirth-Linking, Life-Continuum, and Death. <strong>For one
being in one existence, the Rebirth-Linking, Life-Continuum, and Death
Consciousness are all the same Citta.</strong></p>
<p>There are nine Sense Blissful Rebirth-Linkings. The <strong>Wholesome
Resultant Equanimity-Accompanied Investigating Consciousness</strong>
and the <strong>Eight Great Resultants</strong> are these nine
Cittas.</p>
<p>For certain inferior humans such as those born blind, and for certain
Vinipātika Asuras associated with earth-bound Devas, the Wholesome
Resultant Equanimity-Accompanied Investigating Consciousness is the
Rebirth-Linking. This Wholesome Resultant Equanimity-Accompanied
Investigating Consciousness arises as the result of a very weak
wholesome kamma.</p>
<p>The beings who are born in the human world with the Wholesome
Resultant Equanimity-Accompanied Investigating Consciousness are: those
born blind, deaf, dumb, without a nose (<em>aghānaka</em>),
stammering/drooling (<em>keḷatolu</em>), mad, eunuchs
(<em>paṇḍaka</em>), hermaphrodites (<em>ubhatobyañjanaka</em>), neuters
(<em>napuṃsaka</em>), and stammerers (<em>mamma</em>).</p>
<p><em>Aghānaka</em> are those without the nose faculty.
<em>Keḷatolu</em> are fools who do not even know left from right. Saliva
drools from their mouths because they do not even have the knowledge to
keep saliva in the mouth. Therefore, they are called <em>Keḷatolu</em>.
<em>Paṇḍaka</em> are those with changes in sexual nature.
<em>Ubhatobyañjanaka</em> are those having both male and female organs.
<em>Napuṃsaka</em> are those without male or female nature.
<em>Mamma</em> are those who speak with great effort saying one letter
two or three times.</p>
<p><em>Vinipātika Asuras</em> are a group of spirits living with
difficulty in desolate places like trees, rocks, caves, cemeteries,
forests, etc., having no dwelling place obtained by their merit. They
are also called Yakkhas. They go to cities and villages and eat rice,
curry, etc., thrown away by people. Sometimes they harm infants, sick
people, and other weak people to obtain food and drink. It is they who
accept offerings given by exorcists (<em>Kattaḍi</em>). Not all
Vinipātika Asuras are Rootless Rebirth-linkers. There are Two-Rooted and
Three-Rooted ones among them. Three-Rooted ones among them sometimes
attain Paths and Fruits. Commentaries mention that Yakkhiṇīs like
Piyankaramātā and Punabbasumātā belonging to Vinipātika Asuras heard
Dhamma and attained the Fruit of Stream-Entry. It is said that certain
Petas like <em>Paradattupajīvika</em> and Yakkhas also belong to this
group.</p>
<p>The eight Great Resultant Cittas exist as Rebirth-Linking,
Life-Continuum, and Death in all seven Sense Blissful Planes.</p>
<p>The Unwholesome Resultant Equanimity-Accompanied Investigating
Consciousness, Wholesome Resultant Equanimity-Accompanied Investigating
Consciousness, and the eight Great Resultants—these ten Cittas are
Sense-Sphere Rebirth-Linking Cittas.</p>
<p><strong>Lifespan of Sense-Sphere Beings</strong></p>
<p>Among Sense-Sphere beings, there is no fixed lifespan for beings in
the four Woeful Planes, humans, and Vinipātika Asuras.</p>
<p>The lifespan in <strong>Cātummahārājika</strong> is (500) five
hundred years by celestial count. Fifty human years is one day in
Cātummahārājika. Thirty such days make a month. Twelve such months make
a year. Five hundred years there are calculated by those years. Those
five hundred years are (9,000,000) ninety lakhs of years by human
count.</p>
<p>The lifespan in <strong>Tāvatiṃsa</strong> is four times that of
Cātummahārājika. Thus, the lifespan of celestial worlds up to
Paranimmitavasavatti increases by four times each.</p>
<p>The lifespan in <strong>Tāvatiṃsa</strong> is (1000) one thousand
years by its count. One hundred human years is one day there. By human
years, the lifespan of Tāvatiṃsa is (36,000,000) three crores sixty
lakhs of years.</p>
<p>The lifespan in <strong>Yāma</strong> is (2000) two thousand years by
its count. Two hundred of our years is one day there. By our count, its
lifespan is (144,000,000) fourteen crores forty lakhs of years.</p>
<p>The lifespan of <strong>Tusita</strong> gods is (4000) four thousand
years by its count. Four hundred of our years is one day there. By our
count, its lifespan is (576,000,000) fifty-seven crores sixty lakhs of
years.</p>
<p>The lifespan of <strong>Nimmāṇarati</strong> gods is (8000) eight
thousand years by its count. Eight hundred of our years is one day
there. By our count, its lifespan is (2,304,000,000) two hundred thirty
crores forty lakhs of years.</p>
<p>The lifespan of <strong>Paranimmitavasavatti</strong> gods is (16000)
sixteen thousand years by its count. One thousand six hundred of our
years is one day there. By our years, its lifespan is (9,216,000,000)
nine hundred twenty-one crores sixty lakhs of years.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="fine-material-and-immaterial-rebirth-linking">4. Fine-Material
and Immaterial Rebirth-Linking</h2>
<p>There are two methods for Fine-Material Jhānas due to the Fourfold
Method (<em>Catukka</em>) and Fivefold Method (<em>Pañcaka</em>). In the
Citta Chapter, Jhāna Cittas are shown by the Fivefold Method. The
Fivefold Method is the method where there are five Jhānas. The Fourfold
Method is the method where there are four Jhānas. In the Sutta Piṭaka,
the Fourfold Method of Jhānas is found. In the Abhidhamma Piṭaka, both
methods are shown. Since the Fourfold Method is included in the Fivefold
Method, the classification of consciousness is done according to the
Fivefold Method. Fine-Material Planes exist according to the Fourfold
Method. The Second and Third Jhānas of the Fivefold Method become the
Second Jhāna of the Fourfold Method.</p>
<p>Of the Fine-Material Resultant Cittas, the First Jhāna Resultant
exists as Rebirth-Linking, Life-Continuum, and Death in the First Jhāna
Plane.</p>
<p>The Second Jhāna Resultant Citta and Third Jhāna Resultant Citta
exist as Rebirth-Linking, Life-Continuum, and Death in the Second Jhāna
Plane.</p>
<p>The Fourth Jhāna Resultant exists as Rebirth-Linking, Life-Continuum,
and Death in the Third Jhāna Plane.</p>
<p>In the Asañña Plane, what arises as Rebirth-Linking is Matter
(<em>Rūpa</em>) itself. During the course of existence too, there is
only Matter. At the time of falling away from that existence, that
stream of Matter ceases.</p>
<p>These six are Fine-Material Rebirth-Linkings.</p>
<p><strong>Lifespan in Fine-Material Planes</strong></p>
<p>Since the lifespan in Fine-Material and Immaterial worlds is very
long, it cannot be shown in years. Their lifespan is shown in Aeons
(<em>Kappa</em>). An Aeon is an extremely long time. The lifespan in
Fine-Material and Immaterial worlds is so long because one is born there
through a very powerful wholesome deed.</p>
<p>Of the First Jhāna Planes, the lifespan in
<strong>Brahmapārisajja</strong> is one-third of an Incalculable Aeon
(<em>Asaṅkhya Kappa</em>). The lifespan in
<strong>Brahmapurohita</strong> is half of an Incalculable Aeon. The
lifespan in <strong>Mahābrahma</strong> is one Incalculable Aeon. Since
these three Brahma worlds are destroyed in every Aeon, living for a full
Incalculable Aeon in Mahābrahma is possible only for those born there at
the beginning of the Aeon. Those born in these planes when the
destruction of the Aeon is near do not get to enjoy the full
lifespan.</p>
<p>Of the Second Jhāna Planes, the lifespan in
<strong>Parittābha</strong> is two Great Aeons (<em>Mahā Kappa</em>).
The lifespan in <strong>Appamāṇābha</strong> is four Great Aeons. The
lifespan in <strong>Ābhassara</strong> is eight Great Aeons. The
lifespan of subsequent Brahma worlds should also be known in Great
Aeons.</p>
<p>Of the Third Jhāna Planes, the lifespan in
<strong>Parittasubha</strong> is sixteen Aeons. In
<strong>Appamāṇasubha</strong> it is thirty-two Aeons. In
<strong>Subhakiṇha</strong> it is sixty-four Aeons.</p>
<p>Of the Fourth Jhāna Planes, the lifespan in
<strong>Vehapphala</strong> and <strong>Asaññasatta</strong> planes is
five hundred Aeons each. In <strong>Aviha</strong>, it is one thousand
Aeons. In <strong>Atappa</strong>, two thousand Aeons. In
<strong>Sudassa</strong>, four thousand Aeons. In
<strong>Sudassī</strong>, eight thousand Aeons. In
<strong>Akaniṭṭha</strong>, sixteen thousand Aeons.</p>
<p>The four Immaterial Resultant Cittas starting with Ākāsānañcāyatana
exist as Rebirth-Linking, Life-Continuum, and Death in the four planes
starting with Ākāsānañcāyatana respectively. There are four Immaterial
Rebirth-Linkings.</p>
<p><strong>Lifespan in Immaterial Planes</strong></p>
<p>In <strong>Ākāsānañcāyatana</strong>, it is twenty thousand Aeons. In
<strong>Viññāṇañcāyatana</strong>, forty thousand Aeons. In
<strong>Ākiñcaññāyatana</strong>, sixty thousand Aeons. In
<strong>Nevasaññānāsaññāyatana</strong>, eighty-four thousand Aeons.</p>
<p>There are three Aeons: <strong>“Interim Aeon (<em>Antaḥ Kappa</em>),
Incalculable Aeon (<em>Asaṅkhya Kappa</em>), Great Aeon (<em>Mahā
Kappa</em>)”</strong>. The lifespan of humans gradually decreases until
a time comes when ten years is the maximum lifespan. At that time, a
great destruction of humans occurs due to diseases, war, or famine. Only
very few remain. Then, as humans start practicing good conduct, their
lifespan starts increasing little by little from generation to
generation. That increase grows up to an Incalculable number of years
(<em>Asaṅkhya</em>). Then, by turning to misconduct, humans start
degenerating again. Gradually degenerating, it reaches the time when ten
years is the maximum lifespan. At that time, human destruction occurs
again.</p>
<p>The time taken for human lifespan to increase from ten years to an
Asaṅkhya and decrease back to ten years as maximum lifespan is called an
<strong>Interim Aeon</strong>.</p>
<p>There are four Incalculable Aeons: <strong>“Saṃvaṭṭa (Dissolution),
Saṃvaṭṭa-ṭhāyī (Stand-still of Dissolution), Vivaṭṭa (Evolution),
Vivaṭṭa-ṭhāyī (Stand-still of Evolution)”</strong>.</p>
<p>Once in a very long time, this great earth along with heavenly worlds
and certain Brahma worlds is destroyed by fire, water, or wind. Even for
the world to be destroyed once, a very long time passes. The time during
which the world is being destroyed is <strong>Saṃvaṭṭa Kappa</strong>.
After the world is destroyed, it remains empty for a time equal to the
time taken for destruction. That time is <strong>Saṃvaṭṭa-ṭhāyī
Kappa</strong>. Then the world starts forming again little by little.
The time taken for the world to form and complete is <strong>Vivaṭṭa
Kappa</strong>. The time from the completion of the world until it
starts destroying again is <strong>Vivaṭṭa-ṭhāyī</strong>. These four
Incalculable Aeons make one <strong>Great Aeon</strong>. The measure of
an Incalculable Aeon is twenty Interim Aeons. The measure of a Great
Aeon is eighty Interim Aeons.</p>
<p>The world is destroyed by fire seven times in order. In the eighth
time, it is destroyed by water. The world thus destroyed is destroyed by
wind in the sixty-fourth time. When the world is destroyed by fire,
everything below Ābhassara is destroyed. When destroyed by water,
everything below Subhakiṇha is destroyed. When destroyed by wind,
everything below Vehapphala is destroyed.</p>

<li>The Tetrad of Kamma - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-tetrad-of-kamma">5. The Tetrad of Kamma</h2>
<p>Kamma is a name common to both Wholesome and Unwholesome. Wholesome
is called Wholesome Kamma (<em>Kusala Kamma</em>), and Unwholesome is
called Unwholesome Kamma (<em>Akusala Kamma</em>).</p>
<p>Kamma, which is generally one, is divided into four by way of
functions performed, into four by order of giving results, into four by
time of giving results, and into four by places where results are
given.</p>
<p><strong>The Tetrad of Kamma by Function (<em>Kicca
Kamma</em>)</strong></p>
<p>There are four works performed by Wholesome and Unwholesome Kammas.
(1) Producing Resultant Cittas and Rūpas, (2) Helping the being born of
a certain Kamma to live for some time, (3) Harassing the being from time
to time without allowing him to live happily, (4) Killing the being born
of a certain Kamma—these four are the functions performed by Wholesome
and Unwholesome Kammas.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Reproductive Kamma (<em>Janaka Kamma</em>)</li>
<li>Supportive Kamma (<em>Upatthambhaka Kamma</em>)</li>
<li>Obstructive Kamma (<em>Upapīḍaka Kamma</em>)</li>
<li>Destructive Kamma (<em>Upaghātaka Kamma</em>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus there are four Kammas by way of functions performed. These four
are called the Tetrad of Kamma by Function.</p>
<p>The Wholesome or Unwholesome that produces Resultant Cittas and Rūpas
at Rebirth-Linking and during the course of existence is
<strong>Reproductive Kamma</strong>. Not all Rūpas are produced by
Kamma. There is a group of Rūpas produced by Kamma. They will be known
in the Matter Chapter.</p>
<p>The occasion when a being is first born in an existence is called
Rebirth-Linking Time (<em>Paṭisandhi Kāla</em>). The time of living
after birth is called Course of Existence Time (<em>Pavatti Kāla</em>).
The great thing done by Kamma is producing Rebirth-Linking. Sending to a
good destination (Sugati) and sending to a bad destination (Apāya) refer
to producing Rebirth-Linking. Not every Kamma has the power to give
Rebirth-Linking. Only powerful Kammas have the power to give
Rebirth-Linking. All Kammas have the power to produce results during the
course of existence.</p>
<p>The Kamma that helps the being born of a certain Wholesome or
Unwholesome Kamma to live for a long time by preventing danger and
providing things needed for living is called <strong>Supportive
Kamma</strong>.</p>
<p>Beings born of Wholesome Kamma and beings born of Unwholesome Kamma
receive the support of Wholesome Kamma. It is also said that for certain
Vinipātika Asuras etc., past Unwholesome Kamma supports them to live for
a long time.</p>
<p>The Kamma that harasses the being born of another Kamma from time to
time by causing various diseases, creating enemies, damaging fields and
estates, causing loss of employment, bringing disgrace, creating
accusations etc., without allowing him to live happily, is called
<strong>Obstructive Kamma</strong>. It must be said that Unwholesome
Kammas harass beings born of both Wholesome and Unwholesome Kammas from
time to time. Wholesome Obstructive Kammas exerting power over beings
are unapparent.</p>
<p>The Kamma that destroys the life of a being born of another Kamma
midway, without allowing him to live as long as he should according to
that birth, is called <strong>Destructive Kamma</strong>.
<em>Upacchedaka Kamma</em> is another name for Destructive Kamma.
Mostly, it is Unwholesome Kammas that are destructive. Wholesome
Destructive Kammas are also not non-existent. They are unapparent.</p>
<p>There is no special group of Kammas as Supportive, Obstructive, or
Destructive. Wholesome and Unwholesome Reproductive Kammas that have not
yet found an opportunity to produce a result, and those that have
finished producing their result, perform support etc. at respective
occasions. The names Supportive Kamma etc. are given to the Reproductive
Kamma itself based on actions like supporting.</p>
<p>Some Destructive Kammas only destroy the life of a being. They do not
bring their own result. Some Destructive Kamma destroys the life of the
being and also produces its own result as causing that being to reach
hell in the second life. The Destructive Kamma that came to King
<strong>Bimbisāra</strong> and queens like <strong>Sāmāvatī</strong>
only destroyed their lives. The Destructive Kammas that came to
<strong>Devadatta, Ciñcamāṇavikā</strong>, and King
<strong>Mahāpratāpa</strong> destroyed their lives and also caused them
to reach hell. Causing to reach hell is the Destructive Kamma producing
its own result.</p>
<p>Support, Obstruction, and Destruction of Wholesome and Unwholesome
Kammas exist not only for beings but also for Kammas. A Wholesome or
Unwholesome Kamma that is weak at the time of performance becomes strong
by the support of Wholesome and Unwholesome Kammas performed later. By
that support, a Kamma that would cause birth in a poor family becomes
one that causes birth in a rich family. A Kamma that would cause birth
with short life becomes one that causes birth in a place with long life.
A Kamma that would cause birth in a lower heaven becomes one that causes
birth in a higher heaven. Unwholesome also becomes strong similarly, so
that unwholesome causing birth in animal realm becomes one causing birth
in Peta realm, unwholesome causing birth in Peta realm becomes one
causing birth in Hell, and Kamma causing birth in a hell with less
suffering becomes one causing birth in a hell with more suffering.</p>
<p>Wholesome and Unwholesome Kamma that was strong at the time of
performance becomes weak by the obstruction of Wholesome and Unwholesome
Kammas performed later against those respective Wholesome and
Unwholesome Kammas. Wholesome that had the power to cause birth in a
high place like a royal family becomes one causing birth in a poor
family due to the obstruction of unwholesome. Wholesome Kamma causing
birth in a higher heaven declines to become one causing birth in a lower
heaven. Unwholesome powerful enough to cause birth in a Great Hell
becomes one causing birth in a small hell or in Peta or Animal realms
due to the obstruction of Wholesome Kammas. Those who have committed
sins should perform merits opposed to those respective sins to weaken
their power of giving results.</p>
<p>Certain Wholesome or Unwholesome Kammas completely prevent the result
of another Kamma. When the Supramundane Arahant Path Wholesome arises,
all Kammas liable to give results in future existences become
non-result-producing (<em>Ahosi</em>). Therefore, the Arahant Path
Wholesome is a Destructive Kamma that cuts off all Wholesome and
Unwholesome Kammas.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="the-tetrad-of-kamma-by-order-of-ripening">6. The Tetrad of Kamma
by Order of Ripening</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Heavy Kamma (<em>Garuka Kamma</em>)</li>
<li>Proximate Kamma (<em>Āsanna Kamma</em>)</li>
<li>Habitual Kamma (<em>Āciṇṇaka Kamma</em>)</li>
<li>Reserve Kamma (<em>Kaṭattā Kamma</em>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus there are four Kammas according to the order of giving results.
These four Kammas are also called the “Tetrad of Kamma by Order of
Giving Results” (<em>Pākadāna Pariyāya Kamma Catukka</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Kamma (<em>Garuka Kamma</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The powerful Wholesome or Unwholesome Kamma that definitely produces
its result in the second life is called Heavy Kamma.</p>
<p>In the Wholesome side, Fine-material-sphere and Immaterial-sphere
Wholesome are Heavy Kammas. If a gainer of Fine-material or Immaterial
Jhānas dies without falling away from the Jhāna and without wish for any
Sense existence, that person definitely is born in the Brahma world by
the result of the Sublime Wholesome. There are no Sense-Sphere Wholesome
Kammas that are Heavy Kammas.</p>
<p>In the Unwholesome side, the Five Heinous Crimes (<em>Pañcānantariya
Kamma</em>) and Fixed Wrong View (<em>Niyata Micchā Diṭṭhi</em>) Kamma
are Heavy Kammas. If the view is given up before death, the Fixed Wrong
Viewer is freed. For those who committed Heinous Crimes, there is no
strategy to escape from Hell in the second life.</p>
<p>The result of a Heavy Kamma can only be prevented by a Heavy Kamma.
Therefore, a person having several Heavy Kammas receives birth in the
second life as a result of one of those Kammas. Due to that
result-giving Kamma, the results of the remaining Heavy Kammas are
prevented.</p>
<p><strong>Proximate Kamma (<em>Āsanna Kamma</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The Kamma done or remembered at the time near death is Proximate
Kamma. For a person without a Heavy Kamma, birth after death occurs
according to the Proximate Kamma. Even for one who has done many sins,
if a merit can be done at the time of death, birth in a good destination
is possible. If one can forget committed sins and remember a merit,
birth in a good destination is possible by that. Also, for those who
have done many merits, remembering sins at the time of death can lead to
the woeful states. Getting a good friend (<em>Kalyāṇa Mitta</em>) who
causes one to do merit or remember merit at the time of death is very
useful.</p>
<p><strong>Habitual Kamma (<em>Āciṇṇaka Kamma</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Wholesome or Unwholesome Kamma done once and remembered repeatedly
for a long time, or done repeatedly for a long time in life daily or
once a week, month, or year, is Habitual Kamma. When a certain Kamma is
done repeatedly, the Kammas done earlier become a decisive support
(<em>Upanissaya</em>), making the Kammas done later powerful. Kammas
done once a month, once in several months, or once a year become
powerful as Habitual Kamma only if they are great Kammas done to the
extent of being remembered. The Kamma powerful next to Heavy Kamma is
Habitual Kamma. However, in giving results, Proximate Kamma comes
forward.</p>
<p><strong>Reserve Kamma (<em>Kaṭattā Kamma</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Kammas done in the present existence and Kammas done in past
existences that do not belong to the three: Heavy, Proximate, and
Habitual Kammas, are called Reserve Kamma. When none of the three Kammas
like Heavy etc. exists, birth in the next existence occurs by Reserve
Kamma. In this tetrad, what is mentioned as Heavy etc. is the same
Reproductive Kamma mentioned in the Tetrad of Kamma by Function.</p>

<li>The Tetrad of Kamma by Time of Ripening - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-tetrad-of-kamma-by-time-of-ripening">7. The Tetrad of Kamma
by Time of Ripening</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Immediately Effective Kamma</strong>
(<em>Diṭṭhadhammavedanīya Kamma</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Subsequently Effective Kamma</strong> (<em>Upapajjavedanīya
Kamma</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Indefinitely Effective Kamma</strong>
(<em>Aparāpariyavedanīya Kamma</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Defunct Kamma</strong> (<em>Ahosi Kamma</em>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus there are four Kammas according to the time of giving results.
To understand these four Kammas, one must understand the nature of
Javana Cittas. In a Cognitive Process arising as the performance of some
action, whether wholesome or unwholesome, the Javana Citta performing
that action arises seven times in order. Of them, the first Javana Citta
is weak. The second Javana Citta becomes strong by taking the nature of
the first Citta. The third Javana Citta becomes stronger than the second
Citta. The fourth Javana Citta becomes stronger than that. Cittas
arising after the fourth Javana gradually arise decreasing in strength
one by one. Javana Cittas do not arise again after the seventh Javana
because of that decrease. The first of the seven Javana Cittas is the
weakest of all because it arises first without receiving the support of
a Citta of its own kind. The last Javana is also weak. However, since it
has received the support of similar Cittas, it is stronger than the
first Javana. The five middle Javana Cittas of the process are stronger
than both of those.</p>
<p><strong>Immediately Effective Kamma</strong></p>
<p>The Kamma giving results in the present life is Immediately Effective
Kamma. What is Immediately Effective is the first Javana Volition of the
seven Javanas. The weak first Javana Volition has the power only to
produce Rootless results in the present existence. The first Javana
Volition does not have the power to produce results after death. Even in
the present existence, only the first Javana Volitions of very powerful
Wholesome and Unwholesome acts produce results.</p>
<p>Offerings and hospitality done with great faith to very virtuous ones
give results in this very world. The gift-based merit possessing the
four accomplishments: Accomplishment of Object (<em>Vatthu
Sampatti</em>), Accomplishment of Field (<em>Kṣetra Sampatti</em>),
Accomplishment of Intention (<em>Adhyāśaya Sampatti</em>), and
Accomplishment of Extra Virtue (<em>Guṇātireka Sampatti</em>) gives
results in this world. It is shown that merits gave results in the
present life to <strong>Pūrṇaka the Treasurer, Ekasāṭaka Brāhmaṇa,
Sumana the Garland Maker</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>For those who committed crimes against Supreme Buddhas, Pacceka
Buddhas, Arahants, and for those who committed crimes against great
virtuous ones, parents, and friends who helped them, it is said that the
result of those sins was often received in the present existence itself.
<strong>King Kalābu, King Mahāpratāpa, Mittavindaka</strong> etc.
received unwholesome results in the present existence itself.</p>
<p>Even the first Javana Volitions of ordinary Wholesome and Unwholesome
acts sometimes produce results in the present existence. However, the
person who did the Kamma does not realize that.</p>
<p><strong>Subsequently Effective Kamma</strong></p>
<p>The Kamma giving results in the existence immediately following the
present existence (the second existence) is Subsequently Effective
Kamma. What is Subsequently Effective is the last Javana Volition of the
seven Javanas of the process. Since it is the last Citta of the falling
Javanas, it is very weak. However, since it has received repetition
(<em>Āsevana</em>) from the sixth Javana, it is somewhat stronger than
the first Javana. Therefore, without producing a result as quickly as
the first Javana, it produces Rebirth-Linking and Course of Existence
results in the second life. The seventh Javana is not capable of
producing a result beyond that.</p>
<p><strong>Indefinitely Effective Kamma</strong></p>
<p>The Kamma having the power to give results during the period from the
third life until attaining Nibbāna is Indefinitely Effective Kamma.
Indefinitely Effective Kammas are the five middle Javanas of Cognitive
Processes. Since they are strong, they do not produce results quickly
like the first and seventh Javanas, but give their result whenever
opportunity is obtained during the time from the third life until
attaining Nibbāna. However old it becomes, even if thousands of aeons
pass, if the person wanders in Saṃsāra, Indefinitely Effective Kamma
does not disappear. One volition produces Rebirth-Linking result only
once. Course of Existence results are produced on various occasions.</p>
<p><strong>Defunct Kamma</strong></p>
<p>Kammas that never produce a result are Defunct Kammas. First Javana
Volitions that did not get an opportunity to give results in the present
life, Seventh Javana Volitions that did not get an opportunity to give
results in the second life, and Middle Javana Volitions that do not find
a place to give results become Defunct Kammas.</p>
<p><strong>The Tetrad of Kamma by Place of Ripening</strong></p>
<p>There are four Kammas by way of places where results are given:
<strong>Unwholesome Kamma, Sense-Sphere Wholesome Kamma, Fine-Material
Wholesome Kamma, and Immaterial Wholesome Kamma</strong>.</p>
<p>By the Abhidhamma method, there are sixteen Kammas: Tetrad of Kamma
by Function, Tetrad of Kamma by Order of Ripening, Tetrad of Kamma by
Time of Ripening, and Tetrad of Kamma by Place of Ripening.</p>

<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Unwholesome Kamma - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="unwholesome-kamma">8. Unwholesome Kamma</h2>
<p>There are ten Unwholesome Courses of Kamma: Killing
(<em>Prāṇaghāta</em>), Stealing (<em>Adattādāna</em>), Sexual Misconduct
(<em>Kāramithyācāra</em>), Lying (<em>Mṛṣāvāda</em>), Slandering
(<em>Paiśūnyavacana</em>), Harsh Speech (<em>Pharuṣavacana</em>),
Frivolous Talk (<em>Samphappalāpa</em>), Covetousness
(<em>Abhidhyā</em>), Ill Will (<em>Vyāpāda</em>), and Wrong View
(<em>Mithyādṛṣṭi</em>). There are twelve Unwholesome Kammas by way of
Cittas.</p>
<p>Six facts required for the arising of Cittas such as
Eye-consciousness were shown in the Third Chapter by the name Door. They
are Doors of Consciousness. There are also three facts required for the
accomplishment of Kamma to which the name Door is used. They are called
“<strong>Door of Action</strong>” (<em>Kamma Dvāra</em>). There are
three Kamma Doors: Body Kamma Door (<em>Kāya Kamma Dvāra</em>), Speech
Kamma Door (<em>Vacī Kamma Dvāra</em>), and Mind Kamma Door (<em>Mano
Kamma Dvāra</em>). Body Kamma Door is Body Intimation (<em>Kāya
Viññatti</em>) matter. Speech Kamma Door is Vocal Intimation (<em>Vacī
Viññatti</em>) matter. Intimation matter will be known in the Matter
Chapter. Mind Kamma Door is the mind itself. According to doors, Kamma
is also divided into three: Body Kamma, Speech Kamma, and Mind
Kamma.</p>
<p>Of the ten unwholesome courses of kamma, the three kammas: Killing,
Stealing, and Sexual Misconduct are called Body Kamma because they
mostly occur in the Body Door.</p>
<p>The four: Lying, Slandering, Harsh Speech, and Frivolous Talk are
called Speech Kamma because they mostly occur in the Speech Door.</p>
<p>The three kammas: Covetousness, Ill Will, and Wrong View are called
Mind Kamma because they mostly occur in the Mind Door itself.</p>
<p>Of the Unwholesome Kammas, the three: Killing, Harsh Speech, and Ill
Will occur from the Hatred Root. The three: Sexual Misconduct,
Covetousness, and Wrong View occur solely from the Greed Root. The
remaining four kammas occur from both roots. Those kammas occur
sometimes from the Greed Root and sometimes from the Hatred Root. Since
Delusion is the root for all unwholesomeness, it was not specially
mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>Sense-Sphere Wholesome</strong></p>
<p>Sense-Sphere Wholesome is also threefold as Body Kamma, Speech Kamma,
and Mind Kamma. Sense-Sphere Wholesome done with the help of some body
part is Body Kamma. Kammas like preaching Dhamma done with the help of
speech are Speech Kamma. Wholesome like meditation done only with the
mind are Mind Kamma.</p>
<p>Sense-Sphere Wholesome is threefold as Giving (<em>Dāna</em>), Virtue
(<em>Sīla</em>), and Meditation (<em>Bhāvanā</em>). By way of Cittas, it
is eightfold. Sense-Sphere Wholesome is also tenfold as Giving, Virtue,
Meditation, Reverence, Service, Transference of Merit, Rejoicing in
Merit, Listening to Dhamma, Teaching Dhamma, and Straightening One’s
Views.</p>
<p>Twelve Unwholesome Cittas and eight Sense-Sphere Wholesome Cittas
make twenty Sense-Sphere Kammas by way of Cittas.</p>
<p><strong>Sublime Wholesome</strong></p>
<p>Fine-material Wholesome is Mind Kamma. It is meditative. It is
fivefold by Jhāna distinction. Immaterial Wholesome is also Mind Kamma.
It is meditative. It is fourfold by Object distinction.</p>
<p><strong>Results of Unwholesome</strong></p>
<p>Except for the last Citta of the Unwholesome Cittas, the
Restlessness-Associated Citta, the remaining eleven Cittas produce
Rebirth-Linking in the four Woeful Planes. In the course of existence,
all twelve Unwholesome Cittas produce the seven Rootless Unwholesome
Resultant Cittas appropriately in both Sense and Fine-Material
worlds.</p>
<p>When undesirable forms are met with each Unwholesome Citta,
Eye-consciousness is produced; when undesirable sounds are met,
Ear-consciousness; when undesirable smells are met, Nose-consciousness;
when undesirable tastes are met, Tongue-consciousness; when undesirable
touches occur, Body-consciousness; and regarding those objects,
Receiving, Investigating, and Registration are produced. Even for
Supreme Buddhas, when seeing undesirable forms etc., Unwholesome
Resultant Cittas arise.</p>
<p>Since the Restlessness-Associated Volition is weak, it does not have
enough power to produce a Woeful Rebirth-Linking.</p>

<li>Results of Sense-Sphere Wholesome Kamma - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="results-of-sense-sphere-wholesome-kamma">9. Results of
Sense-Sphere Wholesome Kamma</h2>
<p>Rebirth-Linking in the Sense Blissful Plane is produced by
Sense-Sphere Wholesome. In the course of existence, all sixteen Cittas:
eight Great Resultants and eight Rootless Wholesome Resultants are
produced appropriately in both Sense and Fine-Material worlds.</p>
<p>Sense-Sphere Wholesome is twofold as Three-Rooted Wholesome and
Two-Rooted Wholesome. The four Knowledge-Associated Cittas are
Three-Rooted. The four Knowledge-Dissociated Cittas are Two-Rooted. Of
them, Three-Rooted Wholesome is strong. Two-Rooted Wholesome is weak.
Three-Rooted Wholesome is also twofold as Superior (<em>Ukkaṭṭha</em>)
and Inferior (<em>Omaka</em>). Two-Rooted Wholesome is also likewise
twofold.</p>
<p>If any merit is done with the expectation of appearing as a high
person among people or with the intention of humbling others, since the
intention is impure, that merit is inferior. If unwholesome Cittas arise
at the time close to doing the merit and after doing the merit, at the
time close to it, the merit becomes inferior due to the unwholesomeness
arising on both sides. If after doing the merit, one becomes unhappy
about the merit done, thinking “what I did was foolishness” etc.,
thereby too the merit becomes inferior. Inferior merit is what is called
<em>Omaka</em> Wholesome. The merit that is not defiled by
self-exaltation (<em>attukkaṃsana</em>) or disparaging others
(<em>paravambhana</em>) or by defilements arising before and after, and
regarding which one generates happiness again and again even after doing
it thinking “a good deed was done by me,” is Superior Wholesome.</p>
<p>Three-Rooted Superior Wholesome gives Three-Rooted Rebirth-Linking
and produces sixteen results in the course of existence: eight Great
Resultants and eight Rootless Wholesome Resultants. Each of the four
Three-Rooted Superior Wholesome Cittas gives Rebirth-Linking in the
Sense Blissful Plane and produces sixteen results in the course of
existence. Producing these sixteen resultant Cittas is not done all at
once, but happens at respective occasions as desirable forms, sounds
etc. are met.</p>
<p>The Joy-Accompanied or Equanimity-Accompanied nature and Unprompted
or Prompted nature of a Wholesome are not factors that govern in giving
results. Therefore, it should be considered that Equanimity-Accompanied
results arise from Joy-Accompanied Wholesome, Joy-Accompanied results
from Equanimity-Accompanied Wholesome, Prompted results from Unprompted
Wholesome, and Unprompted results from Prompted Wholesome.</p>
<p>Three-Rooted Inferior Wholesome and Two-Rooted Superior Wholesome
give Two-Rooted Rebirth-Linking and produce twelve results in the course
of existence: four Knowledge-Dissociated Great Resultants and eight
Rootless Wholesome Resultants.</p>
<p>Two-Rooted Inferior Wholesome gives Rootless Rebirth-Linking and
produces only eight Rootless Wholesome Resultants in the course of
existence.</p>
<p>There is also a teacher’s view that “Prompted results do not arise
from Unprompted Wholesome, and Unprompted results do not arise from
Prompted Wholesome.” It is not accepted by many teachers. The
Unprompted/Prompted nature of Cittas is not something happening due to
past kamma, but happens according to the factors present at the time of
generating those respective Cittas.</p>
<p><strong>Results of Fine-Material-Sphere Wholesome</strong></p>
<p>Fine-Material-Sphere Wholesome is also threefold as Minor
(<em>Paritta</em>), Medium (<em>Majjhima</em>), and Superior
(<em>Paṇīta</em>). Fine-Material-Sphere Wholesome associated with
inferior desire (<em>chanda</em>) etc. is Minor. Wholesome associated
with medium desire etc. is Medium. Wholesome associated with superior
desire etc. is Superior Wholesome.</p>
<p>Sense-Sphere Wholesome is a weak Citta. Therefore, many resultant
Cittas similar to it and dissimilar to it are produced by it in various
places. Fine-Material-Sphere Wholesome is a powerful Citta. Therefore,
low resultant Cittas dissimilar to it are not produced by it. It
produces results only in the high place which is the Brahma existence.
Even in the Brahma existence, only Jhāna Cittas similar to the Wholesome
are produced by it as Rebirth-Linking, Life-Continuum, and Death; no
other Citta is produced.</p>
<p>From Minor Fine-Material First Jhāna Wholesome, they are born in
Brahmapārisajja. From Medium First Jhāna Wholesome, in Brahmapurohita.
From (Superior) First Jhāna, in Mahābrahma.</p>
<p>From Minor Second and Third Jhāna Wholesomes, they are born in
Parittābha; from Medium Wholesomes, in Appamāṇābha; from Superior
Wholesomes, in Ābhassara.</p>
<p>From Minor Fourth Jhāna, they are born in Parittasubha; from Medium,
in Appamāṇasubha; from Superior, in Subhakiṇha.</p>
<p>From Fifth Jhāna, they are born in Vehapphala. Developing the Fifth
Jhāna itself by way of dispassion for perception (<em>saññā
virāga</em>), they are born among Non-Percipient Beings. Certain
kamma-believing heretics, seeing the fault in the mind thinking “when
there is mind, there are attachments, oppositions, and delusions; when
there is no mind, they are not there,” generate the Fifth Jhāna by Wind
Kasiṇa meditation wishing for a mindless existence and are born in the
Asañña existence. They are born there with the posture in which they
died.</p>
<p>Non-Returners who have obtained the Fifth Jhāna are also born in
Suddhāvāsa. Others are not born in Suddhāvāsa. Of the Non-Returners,
those with excess Faith are born in Aviha; those with excess Energy in
Atappa; those with excess Mindfulness in Sudassa; those with excess
Concentration in Sudassī; and those with excess Wisdom in Akaniṭṭha.</p>
<p>Immaterial Jhāna attainers are born in the planes starting with
Ākāsānañcāyatana in order.</p>

<li>The Tetrad of Death and Rebirth - The Four Deaths - Abhidhamma
Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-tetrad-of-death-and-rebirth---the-four-deaths">10. The
Tetrad of Death and Rebirth - The Four Deaths</h2>
<p>There are four deaths: <strong>Lifespan-Exhaustion Death
(<em>Āyukkhaya Maraṇa</em>), Kamma-Exhaustion Death (<em>Kammakkhaya
Maraṇa</em>), Both-Exhaustion Death (<em>Ubhayakkhaya Maraṇa</em>), and
Destructive Death (<em>Upacchedaka Maraṇa</em>)</strong>. For every
being, their life ends by arriving at one of those four deaths.</p>
<p><strong>Lifespan-Exhaustion Death</strong></p>
<p>There is a fixed period of living for respective species of beings.
The lifespan of certain animal species is very short, a number of days.
The lifespan of certain animal species is a number of weeks. The
lifespan of certain animal species is a number of months. The lifespan
of certain animal species is a number of years. When wholesome roots
grow in humans, their lifespan becomes long. When unwholesome roots
grow, lifespan becomes short. The lifespan is determined according to
the condition of parents’ bodies, food consumed, and climate.</p>
<p>For beings of species without a lifespan of a week, the growth and
decay of their bodies happen within a week. Therefore, they do not live
more than a week. For beings of species with a lifespan of a hundred
years, the growth and decay of their bodies happen within a hundred
years. They cannot live beyond a hundred years. Even if born among
humans whose maximum lifespan is a hundred years with a kamma having the
power to make one live a thousand years, that person cannot live more
than a hundred years. Why? Because the body supporting life decays in a
hundred years. It is said that those with kamma power can live longer
than the lifespan by psychic power and the power of elixirs. Death
occurring by the expiration of the fixed lifespan is Lifespan-Exhaustion
Death.</p>
<p><strong>Kamma-Exhaustion Death</strong></p>
<p>Certain weak kammas are capable of producing Rebirth-Linking, but not
capable of keeping the person born of that kamma alive until the end of
the lifespan. Those born of such kammas die before the expiration of the
lifespan. That death occurring by the exhaustion of kamma power is
Kamma-Exhaustion Death.</p>
<p><strong>Both-Exhaustion Death</strong></p>
<p>Death occurring by the simultaneous exhaustion of both lifespan and
kamma power is Both-Exhaustion Death. Both lifespan and kamma expiring
at once for a being happens rarely.</p>
<p><strong>Destructive Death</strong></p>
<p>While lifespan remains and kamma power remains, death caused by a
killing kamma etc. done in past lives or a sinful kamma done in the
present life itself, causing dangers like diseases, is Destructive
Death.</p>
<p>Destructive Death is untimely death. It occurs not only from kamma
but also from many other causes. Life is a very weak thing. Kamma is
also a weak thing. Without the help of food and drink etc., if
protection is not provided, kamma power alone cannot maintain life. Life
exists in the midst of danger. There are many life-destroying causes
even inside the body. Outside the body, surrounding the being,
life-destroying causes are filled. Untimely death can occur from every
one of them too.</p>
<p><strong>Nāgasena</strong> Great Arahant preached eight causes of
untimely death to King Milinda. <strong>Affliction born of wind,
affliction born of bile, affliction born of phlegm, affliction born of a
combination of humors (<em>sannipāta</em>), change of season, improper
care of the body, external agency (<em>upakkama</em>), and result of
kamma</strong> are those eight causes.</p>
<p>Affliction born of a combination of humors means affliction born of
two or all three humors (doshas).</p>
<p>Change of season means the fluctuation of cold and heat. Deaths
occurring by getting caught in floods covering villages and towns due to
heavy rains, and deaths occurring by various diseases arising due to
lack of rain and lack of food and water are deaths due to change of
season.</p>
<p>Deaths occurring due to carelessness such as being run over by
vehicles, getting caught in fire, falling into water, etc., are deaths
due to improper care of the body.</p>
<p>Death by external agency occurs in two ways: by one’s own device and
by another’s device. Some die by drinking poison, hanging themselves by
the neck, jumping into water, placing the neck on the railway track,
etc. That death is death by one’s own device. Deaths caused by snakes,
fierce beasts, non-humans, war, thieves, enemies, kings are deaths by
another’s device.</p>
<p>Some die due to killing kammas etc. done in past lives, and also due
to kammas done in the present life itself. That is death by result of
kamma. Taking that everything happens due to kamma alone is a wrong
view. Kamma causes death by creating wind disturbance etc. Therefore, if
someone dies untimely, it cannot be known whether it happened due to a
kamma or due to another cause itself.</p>

<p>To the being dying in whatever manner, <strong>one of the wholesome
or unwholesome kammas done by that person in the present life or in past
lives, or a kamma sign, or a destiny sign appears</strong>.
<strong>Kamma Sign</strong> (<em>Kamma Nimitta</em>) means objects that
were objects for the kamma or instruments for performing it. To those
who did wholesome kamma, Bodhi trees, stupas, Buddha statues, flowers,
lamps, food and drink, clothes etc. appear as Kamma Signs. To those who
did unwholesome kamma, animals being killed, others’ goods, instruments
of killing animals or stealing etc. appear as Kamma Signs.</p>
<p><strong>Destiny Sign</strong> (<em>Gati Nimitta</em>) means things
related to the future birth existence. To beings being born in hell,
great flames, molten metal, burning coals etc., and Yama guards, fierce
animals appear. That appearance happens as if those things are in those
respective places, and sometimes as if they have come near oneself. To
those being born in heaven, divine mansions, chariots, gardens,
wish-fulfilling trees etc., and gods and goddesses appear as Destiny
Signs. To those being born in the human world, the mother’s womb appears
as Destiny Sign. To those being born in the animal womb, forests etc.
appear.</p>

Destiny Signs appear like dreaming. These mostly appear to the
Mind-door. In occasions where Kamma Signs and Destiny Signs are in front
of the dying person, they appear to the Eye-door etc. as well. For
Arahants who will not be born in existence again, appearance of Kamma
etc. does not occur at the moment of death. However death occurs, not a
single being being born in existence dies without one of the three:
Kamma etc. appearing. Even a fly crushed by a hammer dies after one of
the three: Kamma etc. appearing. By appearing thus at the moment of
death, ancient kammas that had been buried for a long time become fresh
as if done at that moment.</p>
<p>The mind of the dying being, to whom one of the three: Kamma etc.
appeared, starts proceeding inclined towards that appeared thing. The
reason for that is the existence of ignorance covering the evil of
existence and craving attached to existence in him without being
abandoned. At this moment, a stream of consciousness taking that
appeared thing as object arises in him. If the kamma coming forward to
give result to him is a kamma causing birth in hell, a defiled stream of
consciousness consisting of unwholesome Javanas arises in him at this
moment. If the kamma coming forward to give result is a wholesome kamma,
a pure wholesome stream of consciousness arises in him at this
moment.</p>
<p>Cittas arise in a being’s body only as long as base-matter
(<em>vatthu rūpa</em>) born of past kamma helpful for the arising of
Cittas exists in his body. If the stream of base-matter is cut off,
thereafter Cittas do not arise in that body again. Reaching the point
where Cittas do not arise again in the body is death.</p>
<p>When the streams of base-matter supporting Cittas are very close to
being cut off, the last Cognitive Process arising in that body arises
for the dying being taking one of the Kamma etc. that appeared at that
time as object. It is called <strong>Death-Proximate Process</strong>
(<em>Maraṇāsanna Vīthi</em>). Since the mental impulse is very weak at
this time, seven Javanas do not arise in that process as in normal time,
but only five arise. Following the fifth Javana, or after becoming
Bhavanga after Javana, or following Registration, or after becoming
Bhavanga after Registration, the Death Consciousness (<em>Cuti
Citta</em>), which is the last Citta of the present existence, arises.
After that, Cittas never arise in that body again. The arising of the
Death Consciousness is the death of the being.</p>
<p>Although Cittas do not arise in that body again after Death
(<em>Cuti</em>), the being’s stream of consciousness is not cut off.
Immediately upon the cessation of the Death Consciousness, the
Rebirth-Linking Consciousness (<em>Paṭisandhi Citta</em>), the first
Citta of the second life, arises in some place as the result of the
kamma that had come forward to give result, taking the very object taken
by the Death-Proximate Javanas. The arising of that Rebirth-Linking
Consciousness is the rebirth of the dead being. Nothing goes from the
body of the dying person to the future existence. The Rebirth-Linking
Consciousness is not something that went there from the present
existence, but something newly arisen right there.</p>
<p>Although the Rebirth-Linking Consciousness is not something that went
from the present existence to the future existence, it is something
belonging to the stream of consciousness that existed in the present
existence. If there were no stream of consciousness belonging to the
present existence, a Rebirth-Linking Consciousness would not arise.
There is also no long time between Death and Rebirth-Linking. The time
taken for Rebirth-Linking to arise following Death is equal to the time
taken for one Citta to cease and another Citta to arise in a Cognitive
Process during the time of living. When a human dies and is conceived in
the deva world, although no one went from this world to the deva world,
since the deva’s Rebirth-Linking Consciousness belongs to the stream of
consciousness of the dead human, the dead human and that deva should be
spoken of as one person.</p>
<p>The main cause for the arising of Rebirth-Linking Consciousness
following Death is the past kamma that stood ready to give result.
Wholesome and Unwholesome Javana Cittas that existed at the moment of
death taking one of Kamma etc. as object, and Ignorance and Craving are
also causes for Rebirth-Linking in respective ways.</p>

<li>Death-Proximate Cognitive Processes - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="death-proximate-cognitive-processes">12. Death-Proximate
Cognitive Processes</h2>
<p>Death-Proximate Process (<em>Maraṇāsanna Vīthi</em>) is sixfold as
Eye-door Process, Ear-door Process, Nose-door Process, Tongue-door
Process, Body-door Process, and Mind-door Process. Of them, Eye-door
Death-Proximate Processes are fourfold: Process where Death occurs
following Javana, Process where Death occurs following Javana-Bhavanga,
Process where Death occurs following Registration, and Process where
Death occurs following Registration-Bhavanga. Kamma appears to the
Mind-door itself among the things appearing at the moment of death.
Sometimes, something present before the eye at the moment of death can
itself be the Kamma Sign. Eye-door Death-Proximate Process arises in
such an occasion. Rarely, the Destiny Sign can also appear to the eye
for someone. In such occasions, Eye-door Death-Proximate Processes
taking the Destiny Sign as object can also arise.</p>
<p>The Eye-door Death-Proximate Process where Death occurs following
Javana is as follows:</p>
<p>If a Form Object which is a Kamma Sign approaches the Eye-door at the
moment of death, after Past Bhavanga - Vibrating Bhavanga - Arrest
Bhavanga - Five-door Adverting - Eye-Consciousness - Receiving -
Investigating - Determining Cittas arise and cease in order, after a
certain Sense-Sphere Javana arises five times in order and ceases, the
Death Consciousness, which is the last Citta of the present existence,
arises and ceases. Following that, a certain Sense-Sphere
Rebirth-Linking Consciousness arises and ceases. Following that, after
that Rebirth-Linking Consciousness itself arises and ceases fifteen or
sixteen times by way of Life-Continuum function in the new existence,
the Mind-door Adverting Consciousness arises taking the present
existence as object, and following that, a Greed-Rooted Javana arises
seven times as attachment to the present existence. After that, Bhavanga
descent occurs.</p>
<p>For the Cittas from Five-door Adverting to the fifth Javana in this
Death-Proximate Process, the object is the Past Bhavanga and the arisen
present form. There are thirteen Cittas from Past Bhavanga to the fifth
Javana. That form has a lifespan of another four Mind-Moments after the
fifth Javana. Therefore, for the Rebirth-Linking Consciousness and the
two Bhavangas arising after it, the object is the present form that was
the object of Five-door Adverting etc. Cittas. With the second Bhavanga
Consciousness arising after Rebirth-Linking, that Form Object ceases
spending its lifespan of seventeen Mind-Moments. Therefore, for Bhavanga
Cittas arising after that, the object is the past Form Objects which
were Kamma Signs.</p>
<p>For the Past Bhavanga - Vibrating Bhavanga - Arrest Bhavanga and
Death (<em>Cuti</em>) in this process, the object is one of Kamma etc.
that was the object of the Death-Proximate Javanas of the existence past
to that. Since kamma-born matter does not arise in the body of the dying
person after the Arising Moment of the seventeenth Citta from the Death
Consciousness, the base for Five-door Adverting etc. Cittas in this
process is the Heart-base arisen with the seventeenth Citta from the
Death Consciousness. The base for Eye-Consciousness is the Eye-base
arisen with the seventeenth Citta from the Death Consciousness. When
Rebirth-Linking arises, the Base-Matter that is the support for that
Citta also arises with it. The base for Rebirth-Linking Consciousness is
the Base-Matter arising simultaneously with that Citta. For Bhavanga
etc. Cittas arising after that, the base is the Heart-base Matter arisen
with the Citta arisen before the respective Citta. Looking at the chart
shown below, the order of Cittas in all four Eye-door Death-Proximate
Processes should be understood.</p>
<p><strong>Eye-door Death-Proximate Processes</strong></p>
<p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17</p>
<p>Tī Na Da Pa Ca Saṃ Na Vo Ja Ja Ja Ja Ja Cu Pa Bha Bha</p>
<p>Tī Na Da Pa Ca Saṃ Na Vo Ja Ja Ja Ja Ja Bha Cu Pa Bha</p>
<p>Tī Na Da Pa Ca Saṃ Na Vo Ja Ja Ja Ja Ja Ta Ta Cu Pa</p>
<p>Tī Na Da Pa Ca Saṃ Na Vo Ja Ja Ja Ja Ja Ta Ta Bha Cu</p>
<p>Ear, Nose, Tongue, Body door Death-Proximate Processes should also be
known according to Eye-door Processes. The difference is only the
application of Ear-Consciousness etc. in places where Eye-Consciousness
applies. For those dying while listening to Dhamma, Ear-door
Death-Proximate Processes can arise. For those dying while smelling the
scent of offered incense etc., Nose-door Death-Proximate Processes can
arise. For those into whose mouth something is poured at the moment of
death, Tongue-door Death-Proximate Processes, and for those dying while
receiving someone’s touch, Body-door Death-Proximate Processes can
arise. The four Mind-door Death-Proximate Processes should be known from
the chart shown below.</p>
<p>Na Da Ma Ja Ja Ja Ja Ja Cu</p>
<p>Na Da Ma Ja Ja Ja Ja Ja Bha Cu</p>
<p>Na Da Ma Ja Ja Ja Ja Ja Ta Ta Cu</p>
<p>Na Da Ma Ja Ja Ja Ja Ja Ta Ta Bha Cu</p>
<p>Any of the three: Kamma, Kamma Sign, Destiny Sign becomes the object
for Sense-Sphere Rebirth-Linking. For Fine-Material and Immaterial
Rebirth-Linkings, only Kamma Sign becomes the object. For them, what
becomes the object as Kamma Sign is the Kasiṇa Sign etc. that are
objects for the Jhānas they have obtained.</p>
<p>For beings born in the Asañña existence, a Rebirth-Linking
Consciousness does not arise after Death (<em>Cuti</em>). For them, what
arises as Rebirth-Linking in the Asañña existence after Death are Life
Nonad Material Groups. Therefore, they are Matter Rebirth-Linkers.
Beings born in the Immaterial Plane are Immaterial Rebirth-Linkers.
Since matter also arises when other Rebirth-Linkings arise, others
except Asañña beings and Immaterial beings are Matter-Immaterial
Rebirth-Linkers.</p>
<p>From the four Immaterial-sphere Deaths, other Immaterial-sphere
Rebirth-Linkings excluding lower Immaterial-sphere Rebirth-Linkings, and
Sense Three-Rooted Rebirth-Linkings can also arise. For one who died
from a higher Immaterial Plane, a lower Immaterial Rebirth-Linking does
not arise. For those dying from all Immaterial Planes, Fine-Material
Rebirth-Linking or Sense-Sphere Rootless or Two-Rooted Rebirth-Linking
does not arise. From Fine-Material Deaths, Rebirth-Linkings other than
Rootless Rebirth-Linking can arise. From the Death of a Three-Rooted
person in the Sense World, all Rebirth-Linkings can arise. From
Two-Rooted and Rootless Deaths, only Sense-Sphere Rebirth-Linking can
arise.</p>
<p>For the person dying after living five hundred aeons in the Asañña
Plane, there is no Death Consciousness. The Life Nonad Material Groups
arising in him for the last time are his Death. He also has no
perception of Kamma, Kamma Sign, or Destiny Sign. After the Asañña Being
Death, a Sense-Sphere Rebirth-Linking arises for him taking one of the
Kamma etc. brought up by the access volitions of the Fifth Jhāna he had
obtained before coming to the Asañña existence as object.</p>
<p>For beings thus conceiving in existence, after the
<strong>Rebirth-Linking Consciousness</strong> ceases, taking that same
Citta and that same object as object, throughout that life time,
whenever there is no other Citta, it arises again and again. The being
lives, his stream of consciousness is not cut off, because that Citta
arises again and again. Since it arises as a support for the existence
to continue, that Citta is called “<strong>Life-Continuum</strong>”
(<em>Bhavanga</em>). It is also that Citta that becomes the last Citta
of the existence. When arising as the last Citta, it is called
“<strong>Death Consciousness</strong>” (<em>Cuti Citta</em>).</p>
<p>Thus, just as Rebirth-Linking, Bhavanga Cittas, Vīthi Cittas, and
Death arise in this present existence, in future existences too, this
stream of consciousness continues rolling as one continuity until
arriving at Nibbāna by the arising of Rebirth-Linking etc.</p>
<p>Seeing the evil of having to die and be born again and again because
of the uninterrupted continuation of the stream of consciousness thus,
the wise ones, obtaining Paths and Fruits through right practice,
cutting off the bond of craving, go to Nibbāna where there is no death
or birth.</p>

<li>The Twenty-Eight Material Phenomena - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-twenty-eight-material-phenomena">1. The Twenty-Eight
Material Phenomena</h2>
<p>There are eighteen <strong>Concretely Produced Matter</strong>
(<em>Nipphanna Rūpa</em>): the four Great Essential Rūpas: Earth
Element, Water Element, Fire Element, Air Element; the five Sensitive
Rūpas: Eye-sensitivity, Ear-sensitivity, Nose-sensitivity,
Tongue-sensitivity, Body-sensitivity; the five Objective Rūpas: Form,
Sound, Smell, Taste, Tangible; the two Sexual Rūpas: Femininity Material
Phenomenon, Masculinity Material Phenomenon; Heart Material Phenomenon;
Life Material Phenomenon; and Nutriment Material Phenomenon.</p>
<p>There are ten <strong>Non-Concretely Produced Matter</strong>
(<em>Anipphanna Rūpa</em>): Space Element; the five Mutable Rūpas:
Bodily Intimation, Vocal Intimation, Lightness, Malleability,
Wieldiness; and the four Characteristic Rūpas: Production, Continuity,
Decay, Impermanence.</p>
<p>Eighteen Concretely Produced Matter and ten Non-Concretely Produced
Matter make twenty-eight Rūpas.</p>
<p>(Memorize these twenty-eight Rūpas.)</p>
<p>There is no separate Rūpa called Tangible (<em>Phoṭṭhabbaya</em>).
Where Objective Rūpas are mentioned, what is referred to by the name
Tangible are the three Great Essential Rūpas: Earth, Fire, and Air.
Therefore, when counting the eighteen Concretely Produced Matter,
Tangible should be left out. Otherwise, Concretely Produced Matter will
be counted as nineteen.</p>
<p>Of Rūpas, the main ones are the four Great Essential Rūpas. The
remaining twenty-four Rūpas arise dependent on the Great Essential
Rūpas. Therefore, they are called Derived Material Phenomena
(<em>Upādāya Rūpa</em>). The group of Rūpas is also divided into two as
four Great Essential Rūpas and twenty-four Derived Material
Phenomena.</p>

<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Four Great Essentials - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-four-great-essentials">2. The Four Great Essentials</h2>
<p>There are four Great Essentials: Earth Element (<em>Paṭhavī
Dhātu</em>), Water Element (<em>Āpo Dhātu</em>), Fire Element (<em>Tejo
Dhātu</em>), and Air Element (<em>Vāyo Dhātu</em>). Because they appear
massively as great earth, mountains, oceans, rivers, etc., they are
called Great Essentials (<em>Mahābhūta</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Earth Element (<em>Paṭhavī Dhātu</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The hardness felt when touching or pressing any object is the Earth
Element. Sometimes when touching or pressing objects, softness is felt.
That softness is also nothing other than a slight hardness. The words
hard and soft are names given to one thing relative to another, like the
words small and large. A thing called small becomes large when compared
to something smaller than it. Similarly, a thing called large becomes
small when compared to something larger than it. Thus, a thing called
soft becomes hard when compared to something softer than it. A thing
called hard becomes soft when compared to something harder than it.
Since facts are such, know that both hardness and softness refer to the
same Earth Element. What is felt by the hand is hardness that is not
very subtle. The very subtle hardness in some things is not felt by the
hand. The meaning of the word Dhātu (Element) is a nature that is not a
being.</p>
<p><strong>Water Element (<em>Āpo Dhātu</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The nature of cohesion/flowing is the Water Element. The nature of
the Water Element is to spread inside and outside of Rūpas arising
together. The nature of the Water Element is to attract what is touching
it towards itself, to absorb, to hold without letting go from itself.
Objects in the world exist bound together and solidified without
scattering like dust by the power of the Water Element. Objects where
Earth Element is excessive and Water Element is slight exist solidified
and hard. Bones, nerves, flesh etc. in bodies, and stones, rocks, iron,
leaves, barks, roots, wood etc. are things with less Water Element and
more Earth Element. If Earth Element becomes slight and Water Element
excessive, a watery thing, a flowing thing arises. Oil, water etc. are
things with slight Earth Element and excessive Water Element.</p>
<p><strong>Fire Element (<em>Tejo Dhātu</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Heat and cold are the Fire Element. Maturing or ripening the Rūpas
existing together is what is done by the Fire Element. During the tender
period, Rūpas mature, become strong, and grow by that ripening. After
maturing is finished, bodies of beings and external objects decay and
decline due to repeated ripening. Both the progress and decline of
respective objects are done by the same Fire Element. In fire, the Fire
Element exists excessively.</p>
<p><strong>Air Element (<em>Vāyo Dhātu</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The nature of inflating and pushing is the Air Element. An object
where it is excessive exists inflated, becoming large and less in
weight. Wind is the thing where Air Element is very excessive. Since the
nature of pushing is excessive, it always moves.</p>
<p>None of these four elements can arise or exist separate from the
other three elements. In iron and stone where Earth Element is
prominent, in fire where the other element is prominent, and in wind
where Air Element is prominent, all four elements are present.</p>
<p><strong>The Five Sensitive Material Phenomena</strong></p>
<p>There are five Sensitive Material Phenomena: Eye-sensitivity,
Ear-sensitivity, Nose-sensitivity, Tongue-sensitivity, and
Body-sensitivity.</p>
<p>The desire to see, the desire to hear, the desire to smell good
odors, the desire to taste good flavors, and the desire to enjoy good
touches—these desires exist very strongly in beings. The kamma causing
the being to be born in existence is connected with those desires.
Therefore, when the being is born in existence, the kamma connected with
desires produces faculties in that being’s body that are instruments to
take and enjoy those desired things. The name “<strong>Sensitive
Material Phenomenon</strong>” (<em>Pasāda Rūpa</em>) is given to those
faculties helpful for taking forms etc. The meaning of the word
<em>Pasāda</em> is clarity/brightness. The names Eye-sensitivity etc.
refer to five distinct clarities helpful for taking different things:
form, sound, smell, taste, touch.</p>
<p><strong>Eye-sensitivity (<em>Cakkhu Pasāda</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The clarity located in the eye helpful for seeing forms is
Eye-sensitivity. It is located in the middle of the black pupil of the
eye, in a place the size of a louse’s head, or according to another
opinion, the size of a lentil seed, spreading like oil on seven layers
of cotton film. When the reflection of objects coming in front of the
eye falls there, the Eye-Consciousness Citta arises there. Seeing means
the arising of that Eye-Consciousness. This clarity called
Eye-sensitivity is not a separate strange thing, but a clarity of the
Great Essentials themselves. It is located in the Great Essentials
themselves. Other sensitivities are also similarly clarities of the
Great Essentials themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Ear-sensitivity (<em>Sota Pasāda</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The clarity located in the ear helpful for knowing sound or hearing
is Ear-sensitivity. It is located inside the ear-hole in a place shaped
like a finger-stall (ring) with fine copper-colored hairs. When the
reflection of sound strikes there, Ear-Consciousness arises right there.
Hearing means the arising of Ear-Consciousness. Since Ear-sensitivity is
a clarity of a different kind, only sound reflection is reflected there,
not form reflection.</p>
<p><strong>Nose-sensitivity (<em>Ghāna Pasāda</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The clarity located in the nose helpful for knowing good and bad
smells is Nose-sensitivity. It is located inside the nose in a place
shaped like a goat’s hoof. The Nose-Consciousness knowing smell arises
there.</p>
<p><strong>Tongue-sensitivity (<em>Jivhā Pasāda</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The clarity located in the tongue helpful for knowing the taste of
food and drink etc. is Tongue-sensitivity. It is located on the upper
surface of the tongue in a place shaped like the tip of a water lily
petal. When food and drink touch there, the Tongue-Consciousness knowing
taste arises there.</p>
<p><strong>Body-sensitivity (<em>Kāya Pasāda</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The clarity spread in the body helpful for knowing tangible objects
is Body-sensitivity. It is spread all over the entire body except for
the area where the digestive fire is located, and hair, body hair,
nails, and dry skin. The Body-Consciousness knowing the touching of
respective things on the body arises in the touched places dependent on
that clarity. Pains inside the body arise due to things inside the body
striking against each other.</p>

<li>The Five Objective Material Phenomena - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-five-objective-material-phenomena">3. The Five Objective
Material Phenomena</h2>
<p>Form (<em>Rūpa</em>), Sound (<em>Sadda</em>), Smell
(<em>Gandha</em>), Taste (<em>Rasa</em>), and Tangible
(<em>Phoṭṭhabbaya</em>) are the five Objective Material Phenomena. These
five Rūpas are the objects (pasture) of the five sensitivities like the
Eye etc. Therefore, they are called “<strong>Objective Material
Phenomena</strong>” (<em>Gocara Rūpa</em>). Since they are caught by the
five sensitivities like the Eye etc., they are also called
“<strong>Sense-Field Material Phenomena</strong>” (<em>Visaya
Rūpa</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Form (<em>Rūpa</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Here, what is called Rūpa is the color that impinges on the
Eye-sensitivity, that is caught by it. It is also called <strong>Color
Material Phenomenon</strong> (<em>Vaṇṇa Rūpa</em>). Only this Color Rūpa
impinges on the Eye-sensitivity and is caught by it. Apart from color,
objects caught by the hand are not visible to the eye. In the phrase
“Aggregate of Materiality” (<em>Rūpakkhandha</em>), the word Rūpa refers
to the twenty-eight Rūpas. This Color Rūpa is also one Rūpa belonging to
those twenty-eight. In the phrase “Objective Rūpa” (<em>Gocara
Rūpa</em>), the word Rūpa refers only to the Color Element (<em>Vaṇṇa
Dhātu</em>). The name Rūpa is used for all Rūpas in the sense of “that
which undergoes deformation by cold, heat, etc.” The name Rūpa is used
for the Color Element in the sense of “that which is visible.” Of the
twenty-eight Rūpas, only this Color Rūpa is visible to the eye. Other
twenty-seven Rūpas are not visible to the eye.</p>
<p><strong>Sound (<em>Sadda</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The thing that impinges on Ear-sensitivity, that is felt due to
Ear-sensitivity, is Sound. It is a Rūpa arising from friction and
bursting, and perishing quickly. Perishing quickly does not mean having
a shorter lifespan than other Rūpas, but the non-continuation of the
lineage for long.</p>
<p><strong>Smell (<em>Gandha</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The Rūpa that impinges on Nose-sensitivity, that is felt due to
Nose-sensitivity, is Smell. It exists excessively in some objects and
slightly in some objects. Although Smell exists in some quantity in
every object where the four elements exist, the smell in some objects is
not felt because it is very subtle.</p>
<p><strong>Taste (<em>Rasa</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The Rūpa that impinges on Tongue-sensitivity, that is felt due to the
tongue, is Taste. It becomes manifold according to the differences of
the Great Essential Elements. Although Taste exists in every object, the
taste of certain objects is not felt because it does not dissolve and is
very subtle. To be able to know the taste, it must dissolve and impinge
on the Tongue-sensitivity.</p>
<p><strong>Tangible (<em>Phoṭṭhabbaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The Rūpa that impinges on Body-sensitivity, that is felt due to
Body-sensitivity, is called Tangible. It is not a separate Rūpa like
Form, Sound, etc. The three Great Essentials: Earth, Fire, and Air
impinge on the Body-sensitivity. The Earth Element is felt by the body
as hardness. The Fire Element is the cold nature and hot nature felt by
the body. The Air Element is the moving, pushing nature felt by the
body. The Water Element is not something tangible. In presenting
Objective Rūpas, since Rūpas that become objects for all five
sensitivities must be shown, the three Great Essential Rūpas that become
objects for Body-sensitivity are shown by the name Tangible. When
counting Rūpas, a Rūpa called Tangible Rūpa is not counted.</p>
<p>In one object, all Form, Smell, Taste, and Tangible exist. When
grasping an object with the hand, what is caught by the hand, what is
felt, is the Earth Element in it. What is visible to the eye is the
Color Rūpa. The part visible to the eye is not caught by the hand. The
part caught by the hand is not visible to the eye. The parts felt by the
nose and tongue there are felt only by the nose and tongue, not by the
hand. Not visible to the eye. Thinking that what is caught by the hand
and what is visible to the eye are the same thing is a wrong notion due
to not knowing the analysis of Dhamma.</p>
<p><strong>The Two Sexual Material Phenomena (<em>Bhāva
Rūpa</em>)</strong></p>
<p>There are two Sexual Rūpas: Femininity Material Phenomenon and
Masculinity Material Phenomenon. The Rūpa that gives the female nature
to the being’s body is the Femininity Material Phenomenon. The Rūpa that
gives the male nature is the Masculinity Material Phenomenon. These two
Rūpas are two Rūpas that exercise their power over bodily Rūpas.
Therefore, the Femininity Material Phenomenon is called
“<strong>Femininity Faculty</strong>” (<em>Itthindriya</em>), and the
Masculinity Material Phenomenon is called “<strong>Masculinity
Faculty</strong>” (<em>Purisindriya</em>). Sexual Rūpas arise in beings
together with the Rebirth-Linking Consciousness. Everyone’s body is
created from the four Great Essentials. There is no male-female
distinction in them. When the body is formed from Great Essentials, the
body with Femininity Material Phenomenon is formed in female form by its
influence. The body with Masculinity Material Phenomenon is formed in
male form by its influence. Sexual Rūpas are spread everywhere in the
body.</p>
<p><strong>Heart-Base Material Phenomenon (<em>Hadaya Vatthu
Rūpa</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The places for Eye-consciousness etc. to arise are the five Sensitive
Rūpas. The Rūpa that is the place for the arising of Cittas other than
the Five Consciousnesses is the Heart-Base Material Phenomenon. It
exists in the blood in the heart cavity.</p>
<p><strong>Life Faculty Material Phenomenon (<em>Jīvitindriya
Rūpa</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The Rūpa that protects and enlivens the Rūpas arising bound with it
so they exist for a long time as a lineage is the Life Faculty. In a
body, there are Rūpas arising from four causes: Kamma, Citta, Season,
and Nutriment. Of those four causes, the three causes: Citta, Season,
and Nutriment are present right near the Rūpas produced by them.
Therefore, nothing else is needed to govern Rūpas arising from Citta
etc. causes. Kamma-born Rūpas in a being’s continuity arise from a kamma
that arose and passed away in the past, which is not present at that
moment. Therefore, there must be another thing protecting Kamma-born
Rūpa lineages so they can exist for a long time. The power that protects
Kamma-born Rūpas and maintains their lineage for a long time is this
Life Faculty Material Phenomenon. By the influence of the Life Faculty,
Kamma-born Rūpa lineages exist uninterrupted for hundreds and thousands
of years.</p>
<p><strong>Nutriment Material Phenomenon (<em>Āhāra
Rūpa</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The nutritive essence (<em>Ojā</em>) in food that produces a new part
of Rūpa in the body, strengthens it, and maintains it for a long time is
the Nutriment Material Phenomenon. That nutritive essence generally
exists in all objects. However, the nutritive essence existing in
everything does not suit all beings. Respective beings eat food suitable
for their respective bodies. Their bodies are sustained by the nutritive
essence in them.</p>
<p>These eighteen Rūpas mentioned from Earth Element to Nutriment
Material Phenomenon are Rūpas produced directly by conditions such as
Kamma etc. Therefore, they are called <strong>Concretely Produced Matter
(<em>Nipphanna Rūpa</em>)</strong>. Furthermore, they are also called
Intrinsic Nature Matter (<em>Sabhāva Rūpa</em>), Matter with
Characteristics (<em>Salakkhaṇa Rūpa</em>), and Material Matter
(<em>Rūpa Rūpa</em>).</p>

(<em>Paricchedākāsa</em>). The hollow of the world which is the place
for the existence of all objects and persons is Ajaṭākāsa. The space
that separates Material Groups (<em>Rūpa Kalāpa</em>) in solid objects
from each other is Paricchedākāsa. What is counted as one of the
twenty-eight Rūpas is that Paricchedākāsa. This Space Element is not a
true Ultimate Reality with a separate arising. However, since space is
also needed between Rūpa Kalāpas for their unmixed existence, it is
counted as one Rūpa.</p>
<p><strong>Mutable Matter (<em>Vikāra Rūpa</em>)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bodily Intimation (<em>Kāya Viññatti</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The special power that turns the speed of the mind-born air element
activating body parts in respective directions suitable for respective
actions is called Bodily Intimation. When a Citta with the effort to
perform a certain action arises, by the power of that Citta, air arises
all over the body parts needed to be moved, just as light arises all
over a dark room when a match is struck. Body parts move by that air
speed. The Intimation Rūpa also arises together with that air. By it,
the air speed is directed to the required direction. Upward and downward
movements etc. of body parts happen as required for the action because
of that direction.</p>
<p><strong>Vocal Intimation (<em>Vacī Viññatti</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The special power that directs sound so that required letters and
required words are formed when trying to speak is called Vocal
Intimation. Sound arises by the mind-born air striking respective
places. That sound arises as required for the matter because of this
Vocal Intimation Rūpa. The name “Intimation” (<em>Viññatti</em>) is
given to these because they indicate the person’s intention.</p>
<p><strong>The Three Rūpas: Lightness etc.</strong></p>
<p>The lightness of bodily Rūpas is <strong>Lightness
(<em>Lahutā</em>)</strong>. The softness - lack of hardness is
<strong>Malleability (<em>Mudutā</em>)</strong>. The fitness for action
or ability to withstand is <strong>Wieldiness
(<em>Kammaññatā</em>)</strong>. These three Rūpas are three qualities of
other Rūpas. Due to facts like bad climate, bad mind, consuming
unsuitable food, not receiving sufficient food, various diseases
arising, etc., a heavy nature unable to work quickly, a hard nature
causing pain in bending and stretching, and a nature unable to activate
the body as desired arise in the body. When climate is good, mind is
good, suitable food and drink are received, etc., these Rūpas:
Lightness, Malleability, Wieldiness arise in the body.</p>
<p>The five Rūpas: two Intimation Rūpas and three Rūpas starting with
Lightness are called <strong>Mutable Matter (<em>Vikāra
Rūpa</em>)</strong>. They are special modes arising in the material body
from time to time. That is why the name Mutable Matter is given.</p>
<p><strong>The Four Characteristic Rūpas (<em>Lakkhaṇa
Rūpa</em>)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Production (<em>Upacaya</em>), Continuity (<em>Santati</em>),
Decay (<em>Jaratā</em>), Impermanence (<em>Aniccatā</em>)</strong>—these
four are Characteristic Rūpas. Both words <em>Upacaya</em> and
<em>Santati</em> refer to the arising of Rūpas. The arising of Rūpas
occurring before the Rūpas required for a being are complete is called
<strong>Production</strong> (<em>Upacaya</em>). The arising of Rūpas
appearing again and again replacing the Rūpas breaking up after Rūpas
are complete is called <strong>Continuity</strong> (<em>Santati</em>).
The aging of Rūpas is <strong>Decay</strong> (<em>Jaratā</em>). The
breaking is <strong>Immanence</strong> (<em>Aniccatā</em>). Since these
are characteristics of other Rūpas, they are called Characteristic
Rūpas.</p>
<p>Since these ten Rūpas: Space Rūpa, five Mutable Rūpas, and four
Characteristic Rūpas are not Rūpas arising directly from conditions like
Kamma etc., they are called <strong>Non-Concretely Produced Matter
(<em>Anipphanna Rūpa</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>Among these Rūpas, the lifespan of the two Intimation Rūpas is one
Mind-Moment. The lifespan of Production and Continuity Rūpas is one
minor moment. The lifespan of Decay Rūpa is forty-nine minor moments.
The lifespan of Impermanence Rūpa is one minor moment. The lifespan of
the remaining twenty-two Rūpas is seventeen Mind-Moments.</p>

<li>Classification of Matter - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="classification-of-matter">5. Classification of Matter</h2>
<p>Since all Rūpas are devoid of roots like Greed, they are
<strong>Rootless</strong> (<em>Ahetuka</em>). Since they arise from
conditions like Kamma etc., they are called <strong>Conditioned</strong>
(<em>Sappaccaya</em>). Since they are objects for taints
(<em>Āsava</em>), they are called <strong>Subject to Taints</strong>
(<em>Sāsava</em>). Since they are produced by conditions like Kamma,
they are called <strong>Conditioned/Compounded</strong>
(<em>Saṅkhata</em>). Since they belong to the world, they are called
<strong>Mundane</strong> (<em>Lokiya</em>). Since they are objects for
sensual craving, they are called <strong>Sense-Sphere</strong>
(<em>Kāmāvacara</em>). Since they do not take objects, they are called
<strong>Objectless</strong> (<em>Anārammaṇa</em>). Since they are not
things to be abandoned like defilements, they are called <strong>Not to
be Abandoned</strong> (<em>Appahātabba</em>).</p>
<p>The five Sensitive Rūpas are called <strong>Internal Matter</strong>
(<em>Ajjhattika Rūpa</em>). The remaining twenty-three Rūpas are called
<strong>External Matter</strong> (<em>Bāhira Rūpa</em>).</p>
<p>Since all Rūpas belonging to the being’s body are generally
considered as “mine,” “myself,” they are called Internal Matter. Among
the group of Rūpas belonging to the self-state, since the view as self
and craving exist excessively regarding Sensitive Rūpas, they are
specially given the name <strong>Internal</strong>
(<em>Ajjhattika</em>).</p>
<p>The five Sensitive Rūpas and the Heart Rūpa—these six are called
<strong>Base Matter</strong> (<em>Vatthu Rūpa</em>). The remaining
twenty-two Rūpas are called <strong>Non-Base Matter</strong>
(<em>Avatthu Rūpa</em>). The name Base Matter is given to six Rūpas
because they are bases for consciousnesses.</p>
<p>The five Sensitive Rūpas and the two Intimation Rūpas—these seven
Rūpas are called <strong>Door Matter</strong> (<em>Dvāra Rūpa</em>). The
remaining twenty-one Rūpas are called <strong>Non-Door Matter</strong>
(<em>Advāra Rūpa</em>). The five Sensitive Rūpas are doors for the five
consciousnesses. The two Intimation Rūpas are doors for bodily and
verbal actions.</p>
<p>The five Sensitive Rūpas, the two Sexual Rūpas, and the Life
Rūpa—these eight are called <strong>Faculty Matter</strong> (<em>Indriya
Rūpa</em>). The remaining twenty Rūpas are called <strong>Non-Faculty
Matter</strong> (<em>Anindriya Rūpa</em>). Dhammas that exercise
lordship over something are called Faculties (<em>Indriya</em>). The
five Sensitive Rūpas exercise lordship over the five consciousnesses.
The five consciousnesses arise in accordance with the sensitivities. The
two Sexual Rūpas exercise lordship over other Rūpas by imparting female
and male natures.</p>
<p>The five Sensitive Rūpas and the seven Objective Rūpas—these twelve
Rūpas are also <strong>Gross Matter</strong> (<em>Oḷārika Rūpa</em>).
They are also <strong>Proximate Matter</strong> (<em>Santike Rūpa</em>).
They are also <strong>Impinging Matter</strong> (<em>Sappaṭigha
Rūpa</em>). The Water Element, Femininity, Masculinity, Heart Rūpa, Life
Rūpa, Nutriment Rūpa, Space Rūpa, five Mutable Rūpas, four
Characteristic Rūpas—these sixteen Rūpas are also <strong>Subtle
Matter</strong> (<em>Sukhuma Rūpa</em>). They are also <strong>Distant
Matter</strong> (<em>Dūre Rūpa</em>). They are also
<strong>Non-Impinging Matter</strong> (<em>Appaṭigha Rūpa</em>).</p>
<p>The seven Objective Rūpas were mentioned because Tangible consists of
three Rūpas: Earth, Fire, Air.</p>
<p>Sensitive Rūpas and Object Rūpas are Gross because they impinge on
each other. They are called Gross because they are not subtle. The
meaning of the word <em>Santike Rūpa</em> is Rūpas that are near. Since
Sensitive Rūpas and Objective Rūpas are Gross, they can be easily known.
Therefore, even if they are far, they are like they are near. The name
<em>Santike Rūpa</em> was given to them for that reason. The name
<em>Sappaṭigha Rūpa</em> is given to them because they impinge on each
other.</p>
<p>The eighteen Rūpas arising from Kamma are called <strong>Clung-to
Matter</strong> (<em>Upādinna Rūpa</em>). The remaining ten Rūpas are
called <strong>Not Clung-to</strong> (<em>Anupādinna</em>). Which Rūpas
arise from Kamma will be known later. The meaning of the word
<em>Upādinna</em> is the thing taken firmly by Craving and View as
“mine” and “I.” All bodily Rūpas are grasped by Craving and View as
“mine” and “I.” Since Kamma-born Rūpas are the main part of the material
body, that grasping exists more strongly in Kamma-born Rūpas. Therefore,
the name <em>Upādinna</em> is specially given to them.</p>
<p>The first of the Objective Rūpas, the Color Rūpa, is called
<strong>Visible Matter</strong> (<em>Sanidassana Rūpa</em>). Its meaning
is the Rūpa that is seen. Of the twenty-eight Rūpas, only the Color Rūpa
is visible to the eye. The other twenty-seven Rūpas are called
<strong>Invisible Matter</strong> (<em>Anidassana Rūpa</em>) because
they are not visible.</p>
<p>Since they take objects like forms, the five Sensitive Rūpas are
called <strong>Object-Taking Matter</strong> (<em>Gocaraggāhika
Rūpa</em>). Since the remaining twenty-three Rūpas do not take objects,
they are called <strong>Non-Object-Taking</strong>
(<em>Agocaraggāhika</em>).</p>
<p>Of the Sensitive Rūpas, Eye and Ear are called <strong>Non-Reaching
Takers</strong> (<em>Asampatta Gāhaka</em>) because they take only
objects located at a distance. The eye sees only something standing at a
distance striking it. If something stands striking the eye itself, it is
not visible to the eye. The eyelid is not visible because it stands
striking the eye. The ear also hears the sound that is far. That is why
the listener knows the direction and place where the sound is. Nose,
Tongue, and Body sensitivities are not capable of taking objects located
at a distance.</p>
<p>Color, Smell, Taste, Nutritive Essence—these four, and the four Great
Essential Rūpas—these eight Rūpas are called <strong>Inseparable
Matter</strong> (<em>Avinibbhoga Rūpa</em>) because they do not separate
from each other. The remaining twenty Rūpas are called <strong>Separable
Matter</strong> (<em>Vinibbhoga Rūpa</em>).</p>

<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>The Origination of Matter - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-origination-of-matter">6. The Origination of Matter</h2>
<p>There are four causes that produce Rūpa: Kamma, Citta, Season
(<em>Utu</em>), and Nutriment (<em>Āhāra</em>).</p>
<p>The Kamma which is the past Wholesome and Unwholesome Volition arisen
with the twenty-five Cittas: eight Sense-Sphere Wholesome Cittas, five
Fine-Material Wholesome Cittas, and twelve Unwholesome Cittas, produces
Rūpas in the being’s continuity every moment starting from
Rebirth-Linking. Those Rūpas produced by Kamma are called
<strong>Kamma-born Matter</strong> (<em>Kammaja Rūpa</em>). Here,
‘moment’ refers to the Arising, Static, and Dissolution moments of
Cittas. It produces Rūpas at the Arising Moment of the Rebirth-Linking
Consciousness as well. It produces Rūpas at Static and Dissolution
moments too. It produces similarly in the three moments of Cittas
arising after the Rebirth-Linking Consciousness. The production of
Kamma-born Rūpas stops when very close to death. Kamma-born Rūpas arise
only in the being’s body, not outside of it. Mansions etc. appearing for
gods due to their merit are Season-born Rūpas (<em>Utuja Rūpa</em>)
where Kamma is also a condition. Since the Immaterial Plane is not a
place for Rūpas, Immaterial-sphere Wholesome does not produce Rūpas.</p>
<p>Except for the four Immaterial Resultants and the ten Dvipañca
Viññāṇas, the remaining seventy-five Cittas are Cittas producing Rūpas.
These Cittas arise while also producing Rūpas produced by themselves.
The Citta produces Rūpas only at the Arising Moment. At Static and
Dissolution moments, the Citta does not produce Rūpas because it is
weak. Rūpas produced by Citta are called <strong>Mind-born
Matter</strong> (<em>Cittaja Rūpa</em>).</p>
<p>Since the Immaterial Plane is not a place for Rūpa to arise,
Immaterial Resultant Cittas do not produce Rūpas. Rūpas are not produced
by other Cittas arising in the Immaterial Plane either. The Five
Consciousnesses do not produce Rūpas because those Cittas are weak.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Rebirth-Linking Consciousness and the Death
Consciousness of Arahants also do not produce Rūpas. There is also a
teacher’s view that “Death Cittas of all beings do not produce Rūpas.”
Mind-born Rūpas start arising from the arising of the first Bhavanga
Consciousness arising after the Rebirth-Linking Consciousness. The four
Immaterial Resultants, the ten Dvipañca Viññāṇas, the Rebirth-Linking
Consciousness, and the Death Consciousness of Arahants are Cittas that
do not produce Rūpas.</p>
<p>This body does not move by itself. The formless mind is also not
capable of moving the body. All actions done by the body such as going,
coming, lifting hands and feet, lowering, etc., happen by the power of
Rūpas produced by the mind. The body of a standing person stands
straight without falling, and the body of a sitting person remains so
without falling, due to the power of Mind-born Rūpas.</p>
<p>Of the seventy-five Cittas producing Rūpas, the twenty-six Absorption
Javanas (<em>Appanā Javana</em>) which are Sublime and Supramundane
Javanas, generally perform not only the production of Rūpas but also the
maintenance of postures: standing, sitting, lying, without breaking.
Rūpas produced by Absorption Javanas are not capable of moving the body.
Therefore, raising a sleeping body to sit, raising a sitting body to
stand, are not done by Mind-born Rūpas produced by Absorption Javanas.
What they do is maintain the posture created earlier by Mind-born Rūpas
produced by another Citta as it is. Not letting it fall. Mind-born Rūpas
produced by Bhavanga Cittas are also not capable of performing that
function. That is why a person standing or sitting falls if he falls
asleep.</p>
<p>The thirty-two Cittas: Determining, twenty-nine Sense-Sphere Javanas,
and two Direct Knowledge Cittas perform producing Rūpas, maintaining
postures, and also producing Bodily and Vocal Intimations. Actions like
going happen by Cittas producing Intimations.</p>
<p>The thirteen Joy-Accompanied Cittas: four Greed-Rooted
Joy-Accompanied Cittas, Smile-producing Citta, and eight Great Wholesome
and Great Functional Joy-Accompanied Cittas, produce smiling in addition
to the things mentioned above.</p>
<p>Of these thirteen Cittas, Worldlings smile with the eight: four
Greed-Rooted Joy-Accompanied Cittas and four Great Wholesome
Joy-Accompanied Cittas. Trainees smile with the two View-Dissociated
Joy-Accompanied Cittas and the four Great Wholesome Joy-Accompanied
Cittas. Arahants smile with the Smile-producing Citta and the four Great
Functional Joy-Accompanied Cittas.</p>
<p>The Fire Element in the Material Groups (<em>Rūpa Kalāpa</em>)
reached the static stage produces another group of Rūpas. Fire Element
is also called Season (<em>Utu</em>). Therefore, Rūpas produced by the
Fire Element in Material Groups are called <strong>Season-born
Matter</strong> (<em>Utuja Rūpa</em>). The Fire Element exists in
Season-born Groups as well. Therefore, know that when Material Groups
produced by all four: Kamma, Citta, Season, and Nutriment reach the
static stage, Season-born Rūpas are produced from them. Rūpas are
powerful in the Static Moment, not in the Arising Moment. That is why
Season does not produce Rūpas in the Arising Moment.</p>
<p>When the Nutriment known as Nutritive Essence (<em>Ojā</em>) in food
and drink etc. enters the body and reaches the static stage, a group of
Rūpas is produced by it as well. They are called <strong>Nutriment-born
Matter</strong> (<em>Āhāraja Rūpa</em>). The Nutriment Rūpa called Ojā
exists in all Material Groups belonging to blood, flesh etc. of the
body. Nutriment-born Rūpas are produced by the combination of two kinds:
Ojā taken from outside and Ojā existing in the body. Ojā taken from
outside is not capable of producing Rūpas without the help of bodily
Ojā. Bodily Ojā is also not capable of producing Rūpas without the help
of Ojā taken from outside.</p>
<p>There is also a teacher’s view that “Food taken from outside helps
bodily Ojā to produce Rūpas, but does not perform production of Rūpas by
itself.”</p>
<p>It is said that Rūpas are produced not only by food eaten but also by
food smeared on the body, and that Rūpas are produced in the body of the
child in the womb by the food eaten by the mother.</p>

<p>Among Rūpas, there are Rūpas arising from a single condition like
Kamma. There are Rūpas arising from two conditions. There are Rūpas
arising from three or four conditions. There are also Rūpas arising from
no condition at all.</p>
<p>The nine Rūpas: Heart Rūpa and the eight Faculty Rūpas are Rūpas
arising solely from Kamma.</p>
<p>The two Intimation Rūpas arise solely from Citta.</p>
<p>Sound arises from both Citta and Season. Sound of speaking is
Mind-born Sound. Sound arising from wind blowing etc. is Season-born
Sound.</p>
<p>The three Mutable Rūpas: Lightness, Malleability, and Wieldiness
arise from all three causes: Season, Citta, and Nutriment. Lightness
etc. Rūpas arise from good Citta, Season, and Nutriment. In Mind-born
Rūpas arising when season is bad, in Mind-born Rūpas arising when mind
is bad, and in Material Groups arising from unsuitable food, Lightness
etc. are not obtained. When Material Groups with Lightness etc. are
absent, the body exists in a state heavy, hard, and not good for
action.</p>
<p>The nine Rūpas: eight Inseparable Rūpas and Space Element arise from
all four conditions. Even in the atom considered as the smallest thing,
there are many Material Groups. There is also space separating those
Material Groups from each other. Although it should be said that Space
Element is something not arising from any condition, by counting the
space existing between Material Groups arising from Kamma etc.
conditions, separating them from each other, also as a Rūpa arising from
those respective conditions, Space Element is said to be a Rūpa arising
from all four conditions like Kamma etc.</p>
<p>The four Characteristic Rūpas do not arise from any condition. They
are said to be Rūpas not arising from conditions because they are mere
characteristics of arising, decaying, and breaking of Rūpas arising from
conditions like Kamma etc. The two Rūpas Production (<em>Upacaya</em>)
and Continuity (<em>Santati</em>) are shown in commentaries as Rūpas
arising from conditions like Kamma etc.</p>
<p>The eighteen Rūpas: eight Inseparable Rūpas, Space Element, Heart
Rūpa, and eight Faculty Rūpas are <strong>Kamma-born Rūpas</strong>.</p>
<p>The fifteen Rūpas: eight Inseparable Rūpas, Space Element, Sound, two

<li>Material Groups (Rūpa Kalāpa) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="material-groups-rūpa-kalāpa">8. Material Groups (Rūpa
Kalāpa)</h2>
<p>Rūpas are not born singly. Rūpas also do not have the power to be
born or exist alone without being connected to other Rūpas. They arise
and exist as groups. In each such group, there are at least eight Rūpas.
Those groups of Rūpas arising together are called “<strong>Material
Groups</strong>” (<em>Rūpa Kalāpa</em>).</p>
<p>A Material Group has a peripheral limit. Separate Rūpas belonging to
a Material Group do not have a peripheral limit. Rūpas in one group
exist as if one Rūpa is sunk in other Rūpas. Other Rūpas are sunk in
that Rūpa. Stated in another way, as if one Rūpa has swallowed other
Rūpas. Other Rūpas have swallowed that Rūpa. There is no simile to
explain this matter clearly. However, a simile helpful to understand the
matter somewhat can be given. That is as follows:</p>
<p>When a little of each of the four types of flour: rice flour, wheat
flour, kurakkan flour, and barley flour are taken, mixed well, and
kneaded with water into a ball, if asked “where is the rice flour?”, it
must be said that it is sunk in the remaining three parts of flour. If
asked “where is the wheat flour?”, it must be said that it too is sunk
in the remaining three parts of flour. If asked “where is the kurakkan
flour?”, it must be said that it too is sunk in the remaining three
parts of flour. If asked “where is the barley flour?”, it must be said
that it too is sunk in the remaining three parts of flour. Now if you
look at all of them together, you will be able to understand that those
four types of flour exist swallowing each other. Know that like flour in
the flour ball, Rūpas in a Material Group also exist mixed as if
swallowing each other. Although mixed, small flour particles exist
separately in the flour ball. In Rūpas of a Material Group, there is no
such separate existence. There is a complete mixture without gap. The
size of a Material Group cannot be stated. It is an invisible thing much
smaller than an atom.</p>
<p>Arising together, breaking together, having one support
(<em>Nissaya</em>), and existing together—these are the characteristics
of a Material Group. The formation of Material Groups also happens
according to a method. Therefore, there are twenty-one Material Groups.
Of those twenty-one, nine are groups arising from Kamma. Six are groups
arising from Citta. Four are groups arising from Season. Two are groups
arising from Nutriment.</p>
<p><strong>The Nine Kamma-born Groups</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The group formed by the combination of Life Rūpa, eight Inseparable
Rūpas, and Eye-sensitivity is called the <strong>Eye Decad</strong>
(<em>Cakkhu Dasaka</em>) Group.</li>
<li>The group formed by the combination of those nine with
Ear-sensitivity is called the <strong>Ear Decad</strong> (<em>Sota
Dasaka</em>) Group.</li>
<li>The group formed by the combination of those nine with
Nose-sensitivity is called the <strong>Nose Decad</strong> (<em>Ghāna
Dasaka</em>) Group.</li>
<li>The group formed by the combination of those nine with
Tongue-sensitivity is called the <strong>Tongue Decad</strong>
(<em>Jivhā Dasaka</em>) Group.</li>
<li>The group formed by the combination with Body-sensitivity is called
the <strong>Body Decad</strong> (<em>Kāya Dasaka</em>) Group.</li>
<li>The group formed by the combination with Femininity Material
Phenomenon is called the <strong>Female Decad</strong> (<em>Itthibhāva
Dasaka</em>) Group.</li>
<li>The group formed by the combination with Masculinity Material
Phenomenon is called the <strong>Male Decad</strong> (<em>Pumbhāva
Dasaka</em>) Group.</li>
<li>The group formed by the combination with Heart Rūpa is called the
<strong>Base Decad</strong> (<em>Vatthu Dasaka</em>) Group.</li>
<li>The group formed by the combination of eight Inseparable Rūpas with
Life Rūpa is called the <strong>Vital Nonad</strong> (<em>Jīvita
Navaka</em>) Group.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus there are nine Kamma-born Groups.</p>
<p><strong>The Six Mind-born Groups</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The eight Inseparable Rūpas are the Pure Octad
(<em>Suddhāṣṭaka</em>) Group.</li>
<li>The group formed by the addition of Bodily Intimation to those eight
is called the <strong>Bodily Intimation Nonad</strong> (<em>Kāyaviññatti
Navaka</em>) Group.</li>
<li>The group formed by the addition of Vocal Intimation and Sound Rūpa
to those eight is called the <strong>Vocal Intimation Decad</strong>
(<em>Vacīviññatti Dasaka</em>) Group.</li>
<li>The group formed by the addition of the three Lightness etc. to the
eight Inseparable Rūpas is called the <strong>Lightness etc.
Undecad</strong> (<em>Lahutādi Ekādasaka</em>) Group.</li>
<li>The group formed by the addition of Bodily Intimation and three
Lightness etc. to the eight Inseparable Rūpas is called the
<strong>Bodily Intimation Lightness etc. Dodecad</strong>
(<em>Kāyaviññatti Lahutādi Dvādasaka</em>) Group.</li>
<li>The group formed by the addition of Vocal Intimation, Sound, and
three Lightness etc. to the eight Inseparable Rūpas is called the
<strong>Vocal Intimation Sound Lightness etc. Tridecad</strong>
(<em>Vacīviññatti Sadda Lahutādi Terasaka</em>) Group.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus there are six Mind-born Groups.</p>
<p><strong>The Four Season-born Groups</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Pure Octad Group</li>
<li>Sound Nonad (<em>Sadda Navaka</em>) Group</li>
<li>Lightness etc. Undecad Group</li>
<li>Sound Lightness etc. Dodecad Group</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus there are four Season-born Groups.</p>
<p><strong>The Two Nutriment-born Groups</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Pure Octad</li>
<li>Lightness etc. Undecad</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus there are two Nutriment-born Groups.</p>
<p>Of these twenty-one Material Groups, the two Season-born Groups: Pure
Octad and Sound Nonad exist outside the bodies of beings as well. The
remaining nineteen groups are found only in the bodies of beings, not
outside.</p>
<p>Whatever thing exists in the world as earth, stones, fire, water,
wind, flowers, leaves, fruits, bark, roots, heartwood, etc., all of them
are Pure Octad Groups themselves. Even in the bodies of beings, the
majority are Pure Octad Groups. Diverse objects completely different
from each other in color, shape, taste, qualities like hardness,
softness, roughness, smoothness, and weight arise from the same Pure
Octad Group due to the difference of the Great Essentials out of which
the Pure Octad Group is made. In some Pure Octad Groups, the Earth
Element is excessive. The other three elements are weak. In some, Earth
and Water elements are excessive, the other two elements are weak. Thus,
due to differences of respective elements, there are thousands of types
of Pure Octad Groups. Manifold objects are made from the same Pure Octad
Group due to this diversity of elements. Since the Space Element exists
outside of groups separating Material Groups from each other, it does
not belong to the groups. Since the four Characteristic Rūpas are mere
characteristics of groups, they are not included in them.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="the-occurrence-of-material-phenomena">9. The Occurrence of
Material Phenomena</h2>
<p>The way Rūpas arise is shown according to the species of beings
(<em>Yoni</em>). There are four species of beings: Egg-born
(<em>Aṇḍaja</em>), Womb-born (<em>Jalābuja</em>), Moisture-born
(<em>Saṃsedaja</em>), and Spontaneously Born (<em>Opapātika</em>).
Beings born in an egg shell like snakes, birds, fish etc. are
<strong>Egg-born</strong>. Beings born in a womb (placenta) like humans,
quadrupeds etc. are <strong>Womb-born</strong>. Beings born from
corpses, stagnant water, leaves, flowers etc. are
<strong>Moisture-born</strong>. Beings like Devas and Brahmas born by
way of appearing according to kamma are <strong>Spontaneously
Born</strong>.</p>
<p>All these Rūpas are obtained in the Sense World during the course of
existence. For Moisture-born and Spontaneously Born beings, the seven
decads: Eye, Ear, Nose, Tongue, Body, Sex, and Base appear together with
the Rebirth-Linking Consciousness. For some of them, sometimes the Eye,
Ear, Nose, and Sex decads may not be obtained.</p>
<p>The non-obtaining of certain faculties for certain beings happens due
to the weakness of the kamma that gave them Rebirth-Linking. It also
happens due to the prevention of the appearance of the faculty by some
unwholesome kamma.</p>
<p>Of those decads, those who did not receive the Eye Decad are blind.
Those who did not receive the Ear Decad are deaf. Those who did not
receive the Sex Decad are neuters. Those who did not receive the Nose
Decad are uncommon.</p>
<p>The four decads: Eye, Ear, Nose, Sex, which are not obtained by some,
are sometimes not obtained by Woeful Rootless and Blissful Rootless
Moisture-born beings.</p>
<p>Certain Woeful Rootless Spontaneously Born beings do not receive Eye,
Ear, and Sex decads. It is said that there are no Spontaneously Born
beings who do not receive the Nose Decad. Except for the non-receipt of
the Sex Decad for Spontaneously Born humans of the early aeon, there is
no deficiency of decads for Spontaneously Born beings in the Blissful
Plane. Moisture-born beings grow gradually after birth. Spontaneously
Born beings are born with complete bodies. There is no growth for them
after birth.</p>
<p>Since they lie in the mother’s womb, Egg-born and Womb-born beings
are called <strong>Womb-dwellers</strong> (<em>Gabbhaseyyaka</em>).</p>
<p>Womb-dwelling beings do not receive many Material Groups like
Moisture-born and Spontaneously Born beings. They receive the three
decads: Body, Sex, and Base at the Rebirth-Linking moment. Of them also,
the Sex Decad is not obtained by some. For them, Eye, Ear, Nose, and
Tongue decads appear during the course of existence. Short-lived beings
live in the mother’s womb for a short time. Long-lived beings live in
the mother’s womb for a long time. For beings living in the mother’s
womb for a short time, the four decads starting with Eye appear quickly,
and for beings living in the mother’s womb for a long time, they appear
after a long time. For humans, the four decads starting with Eye appear
on the last day of the eleventh week after Rebirth-Linking. In terms of
days, it is on the seventy-seventh day from conception. There are other
teachers’ opinions regarding this.</p>
<p>Thus, Kamma-born Groups appear for beings starting from the Arising
Moment of the Rebirth-Linking Consciousness. Mind-born Rūpas appear
starting from the Arising Moment of the second Citta. The second Citta
is the first Bhavanga Citta arising after Rebirth-Linking. Season-born
Groups appear starting from the Static time of the Rebirth-Linking
Consciousness. Nutriment-born Groups appear from the spreading of
nutritive essence in the body. Vital Nonad Groups also exist in the
bodies of beings. However, an occasion for their beginning is not
shown.</p>
<p>It was stated that the three decads: Body, Sex, and Base appear at
the Arising Moment of the Rebirth-Linking Consciousness for
Womb-dwelling beings. They are Kamma-born Groups. It was also stated
above that Kamma-born Rūpas appear in all three moments: Arising etc. of
each Citta. The arising of Body, Sex, and Base decads does not stop just
by appearing at the Arising Moment of the Rebirth-Linking Consciousness.
Three new groups appear again at the Static Moment of the
Rebirth-Linking Consciousness. Three new groups appear at the
Dissolution Moment of the Rebirth-Linking Consciousness. Thus, Body,
Sex, and Base decads appear with the three moments Arising etc. of
Cittas arising in the future. When it is the Static Moment of the
Rebirth-Linking Consciousness too, by adding the three groups appeared
at the Static Moment to the three groups appeared at its Arising Moment,
there are nine groups. When it is the Dissolution Moment of the
Rebirth-Linking Consciousness, by adding the six groups appeared at
Arising and Static moments to the three groups appearing there, there
are nine groups. Thus, understand how the number of groups increases by
adding groups appearing at first moments to the groups appearing at
every Mind-Moment in the future.</p>
<p>The three Kamma-born Groups born with the Rebirth-Linking
Consciousness cease at the fifty-first moment from the Arising Moment of
the Rebirth-Linking Consciousness. That is the Dissolution Moment of the
sixteenth Bhavanga. By the Static Moment of the sixteenth Bhavanga,
there are one hundred and fifty Kamma-born Groups. When the fifty-first
moment arrives, with the groups arising and ceasing there, there are one
hundred and fifty-three Kamma-born Groups. Since there are three groups
arising and three groups ceasing in future Mind-Moments, no change
occurs regarding the number of groups. To this mass of Material Groups,
a Mind-born Group is added at every Arising Moment of Cittas starting
from the Arising Moment of the first Bhavanga. Since every group
produces Season-born Groups at their Static Moments, they are also
added. The nutritive essence of the food eaten by the mother comes to
the body of the being in the mother’s womb. From then on, Nutriment-born
Rūpas are also added to the aforementioned mass of Rūpas. Thus, lineages
of Material Groups arising from the four conditions Kamma etc. exist in
the bodies of beings in the Sense World as long as they live.</p>

<li>The Cessation of Matter - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-cessation-of-matter">10. The Cessation of Matter</h2>
<p>In the time close to death, the arising of new Kamma-born Rūpas stops
starting from the Static Moment of the seventeenth Citta back from the
Death Consciousness. Kamma-born Rūpas born with the seventeenth Citta
cease together with the Death Consciousness. Kamma-born Rūpas born
earlier cease even before the cessation of the Death Consciousness. The
non-arising of Kamma-born Rūpas starting from the Static of the
seventeenth Citta from the Death Consciousness is not something
happening by the power of the Death Consciousness. After the arising of
Kamma-born Rūpas stops, there is room in that body only for the arising
of sixteen new Cittas. Therefore, because the arising of Kamma-born
Rūpas stopped, the seventeenth Citta from that Citta becomes the Death
Consciousness. After that, there are no Base Rūpas supporting the
arising of Cittas in that body. Since Cittas do not arise in that body
after the Death Consciousness, the Mind-born Rūpa lineage also cuts off.
Since there is no arising of Nutriment-born Rūpas in a body devoid of
Life Faculty, the Nutriment-born Rūpa lineage also cuts off. After
death, only the Season-born Rūpa lineage exists there for a long time.
Thus, for the dying being, arising and cutting off of Rūpa lineages
happen again and again in every existence.</p>
<p><strong>Occurrence of Matter in the Fine-Material World</strong></p>
<p>In the Fine-Material World, Nose, Tongue, Body, Sex groups and
Nutriment-born groups are not obtained. Therefore, for Fine-Material
Brahmas, at the time of Rebirth-Linking, the four Kamma-born Groups: the
three Eye, Ear, Base decads and the Vital Nonad appear. In the course of
existence, Mind-born and Season-born groups are also obtained.</p>
<p>For Asañña beings, Eye, Ear, Nose, Tongue, Body, Sex, Base decads and
Sound Rūpa and all Mind-born Rūpas are not obtained. For them, only the
Vital Nonad group is obtained at Rebirth-Linking. In the course of
existence, Season-born Rūpas excluding Sound are obtained.</p>
<p>Thus, the occurrence of Rūpa in the three existences known as Sense,
Fine-Material, and Asañña should be known by way of Rebirth-Linking and
Course of Existence.</p>
<p>In Sense existence, all twenty-eight Rūpas are obtained. The five
Rūpas: Nose, Tongue, Body sensitivities and the two Sex Rūpas are not
obtained in Fine-Material existence. The remaining twenty-three Rūpas
are obtained there. In Asañña existence, the seventeen: Vital Nonad,
three Lightness etc., Production, Continuity, Decay, Impermanence, and
Space Element are obtained. The eleven Rūpas: five Sensitive Rūpas, two
Sex Rūpas, two Intimation Rūpas, Heart Rūpa, and Sound Rūpa are not
obtained in Asañña existence.</p>
<p>The eight Rūpas: Sound, two Intimation Rūpas, three Lightness, Decay
Rūpa, and Impermanence Rūpa are not obtained at the moment of
Rebirth-Linking. In the course of existence, all these Rūpas are
obtained.</p>
<p>This is the method of occurrence of Matter.</p>

<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>Nibbána - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="nibbána">11. Nibbána</h2>
<p>The Supramundane supreme blissful nature that exists at all times,
has no decaying, has no breaking, and must be seen directly by the
Supramundane Path Wisdom itself, is called <strong>Nibbāna</strong>.</p>
<p>Happiness is twofold: Felt Happiness (<em>Vedayita Sukha</em>) and
Liberation Happiness (<em>Vimutti Sukha</em>). The happiness experienced
through faculties like the eye etc. is Felt Happiness. The happiness
arising in the mind and body by seeing good things and good people,
hearing good sounds, smelling good smells, tasting good flavors, good
things touching the body, obtaining loved objects such as vehicles,
houses, estates, fields, clothes, ornaments, money, obtaining positions,
respect and honor, and obtaining other desired things—all these are
<strong>Felt Happiness</strong>.</p>
<p>Liberation from suffering, troubles, and disasters that have come and
that will come in the future is Liberation Happiness. Nibbāna happiness
is not a Felt Happiness. It is a Liberation Happiness. Humans exert
themselves much, spend much wealth, sell even lands when there is no
money, mortgage even the house they live in to get money and spend it,
to be free from certain sufferings that have come, because the
Liberation Happiness of being free from that suffering is a very good
thing, a valuable thing. If Liberation Happiness were a useless,
valueless thing, humans would not spend for it. No matter how much
wealth or relatives one has, one cannot find happiness if suffering from
a severe pain. Even to enjoy the Felt Happiness obtained from wealth
etc., Liberation Happiness must be there. Therefore, it must be said
that Liberation Happiness is the superior happiness in the world.</p>
<p>For these beings wandering in Saṃsāra, there is the suffering of
repeated birth. There is the suffering of decay after birth. There is
the suffering of death. There is the suffering of providing food and
drink etc. There is the suffering of protecting from enemies. There is
the suffering of various diseases arising from time to time. There are
many sufferings occurring from time to time from thieves, enemies etc.
There are sufferings occurring naturally. There are sufferings of having
to become animals, petas by doing bad deeds. There are sufferings of
having to go to hells like Sañjīva, Kālasūtra. If one does not attain
Nibbāna, the mass of suffering one has to receive in the future is very
great. Birth, decay, death etc. sufferings immeasurable in amount are
included in it. By attaining Nibbāna, one is freed from all of that.
Nibbāna is the Great Liberation Happiness of being freed from all of
that.</p>
<p>According to the mass of suffering that is extinguished for the
person attaining Nibbāna, it must be said that Nibbāna is very great.
However, it is a supremely subtle thing. Therefore, it cannot be seen by
people living attached to sense pleasures away from right practice. It
can be seen by those who, established in right practice, engaged in
meditation, have purified the mind and obtained Supramundane Wisdom. It
is not visible directly to mundane wisdom but only to Supramundane
Wisdom. Ordinary people can only inferentially think that there is a
good thing called Nibbāna according to the words of Noble Ones who have
seen Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Nibbāna is very near. It is covered by the Five Aggregates. If the
receiving of Five Aggregates again and again stops, Nibbāna is obtained.
Receiving Five Aggregates again and again by way of repeated birth
happens because of Ignorance and Craving.</p>
<p>For one who lived with great difficulty fighting a great battle in a
region where rain is not received in time, food and drink are scarce,
diseases are abundant, flies and mosquitoes are abundant, snakes are
abundant, and thieves and enemies are abundant due to lack of proper
governance, if he gets to go and live in a good region with good
climate, good dwellings, abundant food, drink, clothes, vehicles, less
diseases, no fear of thieves and enemies, his delusion that the region
he lived in first was good and the attachment he had for that region
disappear. What is called Destruction of Defilements is that
disappearance. After the disappearance of Ignorance and Craving which
are the causes for repeated birth, that person will not be born again.
Since he does not have the Five Aggregates covering Nibbāna after that,
he becomes an owner of the bliss of Nibbāna.</p>
<p><strong>Divisions of Nibbāna</strong></p>
<p>Formations (<em>Saṅkhāra</em>) which have arising, breaking, places
of existence, shapes, have many divisions because they exist separately
from each other. In Nibbāna which has no arising, no breaking, no place
of existence, no shape, and no sign to say or think “this is Nibbāna,”
such divisions cannot exist. The Nibbāna obtained by Buddhas, Pacceka
Buddhas, and Arahants who lived in the past, and the Nibbāna to be
arrived at by Buddhas, Pacceka Buddhas, and Buddha’s disciples appearing
in the world in the future, is one Dhamma by peaceful characteristic and
extinguishing nature. That Element of Nibbāna, which has no sign to say
or think, can be shown or thought of according to the aggregates that
are extinguished. Since the extinguished aggregates are reasons to show
that Nibbāna as two, according to that fact, it is preached that Nibbāna
is twofold as <strong>Nibbāna Element with Residue Remaining
(<em>Saupādisesa Nibbāna Dhātu</em>)</strong> and <strong>Nibbāna
Element without Residue Remaining (<em>Anupādisesa Nibbāna
Dhātu</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Upadi</strong> is a name for the aggregates grasped by
Craving and View as “I” and “mine.” The Nibbāna of the person who has
seen Nibbāna directly with Supramundane Path Wisdom, where defilements
and future aggregates are extinguished, but only the present five
aggregates remain, is called <strong>Nibbāna Element with Residue
Remaining</strong> because the aggregates called Upadi remain as
residue.</p>
<p>The Nibbāna Element obtained after passing away
(<em>Parinibbāna</em>) by the person who has destroyed all defilements
and existed with only the present five aggregates is called
<strong>Nibbāna Element without Residue Remaining</strong> because the
aggregates called Upadi do not remain for him. The two elements of
Nibbāna are also called in Commentaries as Extinguishment of Defilements
(<em>Kilesa Parinibbāna</em>) and Extinguishment of Aggregates
(<em>Khandha Parinibbāna</em>).</p>
<p>Nibbāna is threefold by way of modes as <strong>Void
(<em>Suññata</em>), Signless (<em>Animitta</em>), and Desireless
(<em>Appaṇihita</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>When defilements like lust exist, there is the impediment of having
to do various bad deeds, the impediment of having to go to hell by doing
bad deeds, the impediment of having to protect oneself by abstaining
from bad deeds for the wise, and the impediment of having to suffer much
to suppress defilements and destroy defilements. All those impediments
disappear with the cessation of defilements. Since Nibbāna, which is the
cessation of defilements and aggregates, is the place that removes all
those impediments—the place without impediments—it is called
<strong>Void</strong> (<em>Suññata</em>). The meaning of Void is the
place without impediments due to defilements.</p>
<p>In formations which have arising, existence as a continuity, and
breaking, there is a special mode helpful for distinguishing one from
another as “this is one, this is another, this is good, this is bad.”
That is called “<strong>Sign</strong>” (<em>Nimitta</em>). Those
formations with signs become objects for defilements like lust, and for
manifold sufferings like decay and death. If there is anything called
suffering, all of it is in Dhammas with signs.</p>
<p>In Nibbāna, there is no sign to distinguish one from another as “this
is the Nibbāna of Supreme Buddhas, this is the Nibbāna of Pacceka
Buddhas, this is the Nibbāna of Buddha’s disciples, this is the Nibbāna
of humans, this is the Nibbāna of gods, this is the Nibbāna of Brahmas,
this is the Nibbāna of Buddhas of such and such aeon.” It exists always
as one Dhamma. Since there are no signs that are places for defilements,
the Nibbāna Element is called <strong>Signless</strong>
(<em>Animitta</em>).</p>
<p>“Paṇihita” is a name for desire. Perishing is the nature of
formations. Since formations perish however much obtained, the desire to
obtain again and again arises in the being. Formations are things that
create the desire to obtain again and again. That desire is the root of
all suffering. The Nibbāna Element, which is the cessation nature of
formations that create desire-suffering, since it is a Dhamma existing
at all times without decaying or breaking, is not something that creates
the desire to obtain again and again. That desire is not in Nibbāna.
Therefore, the Nibbāna Element is called <strong>Desireless</strong>
(<em>Appaṇihita</em>).</p>
<p>Void, Signless, Desireless—these are names given to Nibbāna based on
respective qualities. There are many other names given to Nibbāna. Among
those names, the most famous name is Nibbāna (Nirvāṇa). Its meaning is
the Dhamma departed from Craving (<em>Vāna</em>). Nibbāna is not caught
by Craving. Craving is also not in Nibbāna. This is the <strong>Analysis
of Nibbāna</strong>.</p>
<p>Herewith, the four Ultimate Realities: Citta, Cetasika, Rūpa, and
Nibbāna have been explained to a certain extent.</p>

<p>Since the one hundred and seventy Ultimate Realities: eighty-nine
Cittas, fifty-two Cetasikas, twenty-eight Rūpas, and Nibbāna are shown

<strong>Compendium of Categories (<em>Samuccaya

<p><strong>Compendium of Categories</strong> consists of four parts:
Compendium of the Unwholesome, Compendium of Mixed Categories,
Compendium of Requisites of Enlightenment, and Compendium of the

<!-- Source: 8-1-1.html -->
<p>Taints (Āsava) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="taints-āsava">Taints (Āsava)</h3>
<p>There are four Taints: <strong>Taint of Sensual Desire
(<em>Kāmāsava</em>), Taint of Existence (<em>Bhavāsava</em>), Taint of
Wrong Views (<em>Diṭṭhāsava</em>), and Taint of Ignorance
(<em>Avijjāsava</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>The gross greed consisting of desire for the five sensual pleasures:
form, sound, smell, taste, tangible, is <strong>Taint of Sensual
Desire</strong>.</p>
<p>The desire existing regarding Fine-material and Immaterial Wholesome
and the Fine-material and Immaterial existences received as their
results is <strong>Taint of Existence</strong>. Both Taint of Sensual
Desire and Taint of Existence refer to the Greed (<em>Lobha</em>)
Cetasika.</p>
<p>All views are called <strong>Taint of Wrong Views</strong>.</p>
<p>The Delusion (<em>Moha</em>) Cetasika covering the true nature of
Dhammas is <strong>Taint of Ignorance</strong>.</p>
<p>When taking by way of Dhamma, Taint refers to the three Cetasikas:
Greed, Wrong View, and Delusion.</p>
<p>Water that has been fermented for a long time mixed with substances
is called <strong>Āsava</strong>. That water has the nature of
intoxicating those who drink it. Since they are similar to Āsava because
of fermenting for a long time and because of intoxicating, the name
“Āsava” is used for the aforementioned three Dhammas like Greed. Those
three Dhammas like Greed are similar to Āsava because they have
fermented in the continuity of beings for a long time in Saṃsāra and
because they intoxicate beings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the name “Āsava” is used for those Dhammas in the sense
of flowing out, flowing. Like pus flowing from a wound, those Dhammas
like Greed flow from doors like the eye. Those Dhammas flow overcoming
mundane Dhammas up to the Change-of-lineage Citta, and overcoming the
world up to the Pinnacle of Existence (<em>Bhavāgra</em>).</p>

<p>Floods (Ogha) and Bonds (Yoga) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="floods-ogha-and-bonds-yoga">Floods (Ogha) and Bonds (Yoga)</h3>
<p>There are four Floods: <strong>Flood of Sensual Desire
(<em>Kāmogha</em>), Flood of Existence (<em>Bhavogha</em>), Flood of
Wrong Views (<em>Diṭṭhogha</em>), and Flood of Ignorance
(<em>Avijjogha</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>There are four Bonds: <strong>Bond of Sensual Desire (<em>Kāma
Yoga</em>), Bond of Existence (<em>Bhava Yoga</em>), Bond of Wrong Views
(<em>Diṭṭhi Yoga</em>), and Bond of Ignorance (<em>Avijjā
Yoga</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>Flood of Sensual Desire, Bond of Sensual Desire etc. can be
understood according to Taints. A great mass of water flowing covering
fields, gardens, and villages is called ‘<strong>Ogha</strong>’. Sinking
the being caught in it, not allowing him to escape easily, is the nature
of a Flood. Since the three Dhammas like Greed also sink beings in
Saṃsāra like a flowing mass of water, and since they do not allow
escaping as long as those Dhammas exist in the being’s continuity, they
are called “Ogha” because they are like a mass of water. The Dhammas
that do not allow beings sinking in the ocean of Saṃsāra to get out of
the ocean of Saṃsāra are Floods. Those same Dhammas are called
<strong>Yoga</strong> (Bonds) because they yoke beings again and again
in the wheel of Saṃsāra. To the same Dhamma, “Āsava” is said due to
meanings like intoxicating, “Ogha” is said because of sinking beings in
the ocean of Saṃsāra, and “Yoga” is said because of yoking in the wheel
of Saṃsāra.</p>

<p>Knots (Gantha) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="knots-gantha">Knots (Gantha)</h3>
<p>There are four Knots: <strong>Bodily Knot of Covetousness
(<em>Abhijjhā Kāyagantha</em>), Bodily Knot of Ill Will (<em>Vyāpāda
Kāyagantha</em>), Bodily Knot of Adherence to Rites and Ceremonies
(<em>Sīlabbataparāmāsa Kāyagantha</em>), and Bodily Knot of Dogmatic
Belief that “This alone is the Truth” (<em>Idaṃsaccābhinivesa
Kāyagantha</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>‘Bodily Knot of Covetousness’ is Greed (<em>Lobha</em>). All greed
existing as Sensual Lust, Fine-material Lust, and Immaterial Lust is
included in it. ‘Bodily Knot of Ill Will’ is Hatred (<em>Dosa</em>)
arising in various ways. ‘Bodily Knot of Adherence to Rites and
Ceremonies’ is the wrong view taking cow-asceticism, dog-asceticism
etc., which are not reasons for release from Saṃsāra suffering, as the
path to Nibbāna. ‘Bodily Knot of Dogmatic Belief that “This alone is the
Truth”’ is the view taking a wrong thing firmly as “Only this is the
truth, everything else is false,” “There is an eternal soul,” etc.</p>
<p>Both Adherence to Rites and Ceremonies and Dogmatic Belief that “This
alone is the Truth” are the same View (<em>Diṭṭhi</em>) Cetasika when
taken as Dhamma. Therefore, by way of Dhamma, there are actually three
Knots: Greed, Hatred, and View. These three Dhammas connect the present
existence and the future existence for the being so that he cannot
depart from Saṃsāra, so that the succession of existence does not cut
off after death. Therefore, those Dhammas are called Knots.</p>

<p>Clinging (Upādāna) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="clinging-upādāna">Clinging (Upādāna)</h3>
<p>There are four Clingings: <strong>Clinging to Sense Pleasures
(<em>Kāmupādāna</em>), Clinging to Wrong Views (<em>Diṭṭhupādāna</em>),
Clinging to Rites and Ceremonies (<em>Sīlabbatupādāna</em>), and
Clinging to a Doctrine of Self (<em>Attavādupādāna</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>The Dhamma that holds something firmly so it is not easily released
is called <strong>Upādāna</strong>. The greed holding firmly to sense
objects like forms is called ‘Kāmupādāna’. The wrong opinion holding
firmly “this is the truth” is called ‘Diṭṭhupādāna’. The nature of
wrongly holding firmly to wrong virtues and wrong vows that are not the
path to Nibbāna as the path to Nibbāna is ‘Sīlabbatupādāna’. The nature
of holding firmly to forms etc. as self is ‘Attavādupādāna’.</p>
<p>Kāmupādāna is the Greed Cetasika. The remaining three Clingings are
all the same View Cetasika by way of Dhamma. Therefore, when taken as
Dhamma, there are two Clingings: Greed and View.</p>

<p>Hindrances (Nīvaraṇa) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="hindrances-nīvaraṇa">Hindrances (Nīvaraṇa)</h3>
<p>There are six Hindrances: <strong>Hindrance of Sensual Desire
(<em>Kāmacchanda Nīvaraṇa</em>), Hindrance of Ill Will (<em>Vyāpāda
Nīvaraṇa</em>), Hindrance of Sloth and Torpor (<em>Thīna-Middha
Nīvaraṇa</em>), Hindrance of Restlessness and Worry
(<em>Uddhacca-Kukkucca Nīvaraṇa</em>), Hindrance of Doubt
(<em>Vicikicchā Nīvaraṇa</em>), and Hindrance of Ignorance (<em>Avijjā
Nīvaraṇa</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>Dhammas that cover unarisen wholesome states from arising and arisen
wholesome states from continuing, hindering the wholesome, are called
Hindrances.</p>
<p>Strong Greed is the Hindrance of Sensual Desire. Hatred is the
Hindrance of Ill Will. Hindrance of Sloth and Torpor etc. are the
Cetasikas indicated by those names. Hindrance of Ignorance is the
Delusion (<em>Moha</em>) Cetasika.</p>
<p>Greed, Hatred, Sloth, Torpor, Restlessness, Worry, Doubt, and
Delusion—there are eight Hindrances by way of Cetasika Dhammas.</p>
<p>The two Cetasikas Sloth and Torpor, and the two Cetasikas
Restlessness and Worry, have been preached as one Hindrance each due to
similarities in function, cause of arising, and opposed Dhamma. Both
Sloth and Torpor perform the single function of shrinking the mind. Both
Restlessness and Worry perform the function of agitating the mind. The
cause for both Sloth and Torpor is laziness and inactivity of the body.
The cause for both Restlessness and Worry is thinking about relatives’
distress etc. Both Sloth and Torpor are opposed to Energy
(<em>Viriya</em>). Both Restlessness and Worry are opposed to Calm
(<em>Samatha</em>). Due to these similarities, Sloth and Torpor have
been preached as one Hindrance, and Restlessness and Worry as one
Hindrance.</p>

<p>Latent Dispositions (Anusaya) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="latent-dispositions-anusaya">Latent Dispositions (Anusaya)</h3>
<p>There are seven Latent Disposition Dhammas: <strong>Latent
Disposition to Sensual Lust (<em>Kāmarāgānusaya</em>), Latent
Disposition to Attachment to Existence (<em>Bhavarāgānusaya</em>),
Latent Disposition to Aversion (<em>Paṭighānusaya</em>), Latent
Disposition to Conceit (<em>Mānānusaya</em>), Latent Disposition to
Wrong View (<em>Diṭṭhānusaya</em>), Latent Disposition to Doubt
(<em>Vicikicchānusaya</em>), and Latent Disposition to Ignorance
(<em>Avijjānusaya</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>Sensual Lust etc. existing suppressed in the continuity of beings so
they can rise up when a cause comes are called Latent Dispositions.
Since they have not arisen as separate Ultimate Realities, their
existence is unapparent. Their existence becomes apparent when a cause
arises.</p>
<p>There are three stages of Sensual Lust etc.: “Latent Stage
(<em>Anusaya Avasthā</em>), Obsessive Stage (<em>Pariyuṭṭhāna
Avasthā</em>), and Transgressive Stage (<em>Vītikkama
Avasthā</em>)”.</p>
<p>For persons who have not eradicated Sensual Lust etc. by the
Supramundane Path Wisdom so they never arise again, although Sensual
Lust etc. are not apparent, they exist suppressed as if sleeping, able
to surface upon meeting beautiful men and women etc. Even for great
ascetics who have completely moved away from sensual pleasures, gone to
the forest and generated Jhānas, when Sensual Lust rises up due to
meeting certain objects, they fall away from Jhāna because it existed
suppressed in the continuity in a way that its existence was not felt.
The stage of Sensual Lust etc. existing suppressed so they can rise up
when a cause arises is the ‘<strong>Latent</strong>’ stage.</p>
<p>Sensual Lust etc. existing in the Latent stage surface when a cause
like seeing beautiful male or female forms occurs. They rise up. Rising
up means arriving at the three moments of Arising etc. together with the
Javana Citta. Thus arriving at the three moments Arising etc. together
with the Javana Citta is the ‘<strong>Obsessive</strong>’ stage of
Sensual Lust etc.</p>
<p>Sometimes the risen Sensual Lust etc. subside right there. Sometimes
without subsiding there, they come to the body and speech doors and
start engaging in action. Wrongdoing according to the risen Sensual Lust
etc. is the coming into activity of Sensual Lust etc. The stage of
acting of Sensual Lust etc. is the ‘<strong>Transgressive</strong>’
stage. Of these three stages of Greed etc., Greed etc. in the first
Latent stage are called Latent Dispositions. They are not definite
Ultimate Realities. Since they are a certain stage of Ultimate
Realities, they are not non-Ultimate Realities either.</p>
<p>Sensual Craving existing suppressed so it can arise when a cause
occurs is Latent Disposition to Sensual Lust. Such craving for
Fine-Material and Immaterial existence is Latent Disposition to
Attachment to Existence. Hatred is Latent Disposition to Aversion.
Conceit, Wrong View, and Doubt Cetasikas are Latent Dispositions to
Conceit, Wrong View, and Doubt. Delusion is Latent Disposition to
Ignorance. Thus, although there are seven Latent Dispositions, since
Latent Disposition to Sensual Lust and Latent Disposition to Attachment
to Existence are both the single Greed Cetasika, there are six Latent
Dispositions by way of Cetasika Dhammas.</p>

<p>Fetters (Saṃyojana) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="fetters-saṃyojana">Fetters (Saṃyojana)</h3>
<p>There are ten Fetters by the Suttanta method: <strong>Sensual Lust
Fetter (<em>Kāmarāga Saṃyojana</em>), Fine-Material Lust Fetter
(<em>Rūparāga Saṃyojana</em>), Immaterial Lust Fetter (<em>Arūparāga
Saṃyojana</em>), Aversion Fetter (<em>Paṭigha Saṃyojana</em>), Conceit
Fetter (<em>Māna Saṃyojana</em>), Wrong View Fetter (<em>Diṭṭhi
Saṃyojana</em>), Adherence to Rites and Ceremonies Fetter
(<em>Sīlabbataparāmāsa Saṃyojana</em>), Doubt Fetter (<em>Vicikicchā
Saṃyojana</em>), Restlessness Fetter (<em>Uddhacca Saṃyojana</em>), and
Ignorance Fetter (<em>Avijjā Saṃyojana</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>There are ten Fetters by the Abhidhamma method: <strong>Sensual Lust
Fetter, Attachment to Existence Fetter (<em>Bhavarāga Saṃyojana</em>),
Aversion Fetter, Conceit Fetter, Wrong View Fetter, Adherence to Rites
and Ceremonies Fetter, Doubt Fetter, Envy Fetter (<em>Issā
Saṃyojana</em>), Avarice Fetter (<em>Macchariya Saṃyojana</em>), and
Ignorance Fetter</strong>.</p>
<p>Since they are ropes binding beings in Saṃsāra without allowing them
to escape from Saṃsāra suffering, these Dhammas like Sensual Lust are
called Fetters. The two cravings Fine-Material and Immaterial shown by
the name Existence (<em>Bhava</em>) in Taints etc. are shown here as
two: Fine-Material Lust Fetter and Immaterial Lust Fetter. Sensual Lust
Fetter, Fine-Material Lust Fetter, and Immaterial Lust Fetter—all these
three, when taken as Dhamma, are the single Greed Cetasika. What is
taken by both Wrong View Fetter and Adherence to Rites and Ceremonies
Fetter is the single Wrong View Cetasika. Therefore, by way of Cetasika
Dhammas, there are nine Fetters. Greed, Hatred, Delusion, Wrong View,
Conceit, Doubt, Restlessness, Envy, and Avarice—these are the nine
Fetters.</p>

<p>Defilements (Kilesa) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="defilements-kilesa">Defilements (Kilesa)</h3>
<p>There are ten Defilements: <strong>Greed, Hatred, Delusion, Conceit,
Wrong View, Doubt, Sloth, Restlessness, Shamelessness, and Fearlessness
of Wrongdoing</strong>.</p>
<p>Greed etc. ten are called Defilements in the sense that they are
Dhammas that burn and scorch the being’s continuity, and in the sense
that they are Dhammas that defile and lead to a low state. The nature of
these Dhammas should be known as shown in the Cetasika Chapter. Of these
Dhammas, the burning and scorching nature exists excessively in Greed
and Hatred. It must be said that the defiling nature exists in all of
them without difference.</p>
<p><strong>The One Thousand Five Hundred Defilements</strong></p>
<p>The method of counting one thousand five hundred defilements is as
follows: All Cittas are counted as one Dhamma because they are similar
in the characteristic of cognizing the object. The Citta and fifty-two
Cetasikas—this group of Dhammas is called the fifty-three Name Dhammas
(<em>Nāma Dhamma</em>). The fifty-three Name Dhammas, eighteen
Concretely Produced Matter, and four Characteristic Rūpas—these
seventy-five Dhammas become one hundred and fifty when doubled as
Internal and External. Defilements arise taking those one hundred and
fifty Dhammas as object. Therefore, those one hundred and fifty Dhammas
are multiplied by the ten Defilements. When done so, it becomes one
thousand five hundred. That is called the One Thousand Five Hundred
Defilements.</p>

<h2 id="compendium-of-mixed-categories">2. Compendium of Mixed
Categories</h2>
<p><strong>Lesson 3</strong></p>
<p>The Compendium of Mixed Categories consists of seven parts of
Dhammas: <strong>Root (<em>Hetu</em>), Jhāna Factor (<em>Jhānaṅga</em>),
Path Factor (<em>Maggāṅga</em>), Faculty (<em>Indriya</em>), Power
(<em>Bala</em>), Predominant (<em>Adhipati</em>), and Nutriment
(<em>Āhāra</em>)</strong>. It is called Compendium of Mixed Categories
because the groups of Dhammas shown here contain both Wholesome and
Unwholesome types.</p>
<!-- Source: 8-2-1.html -->
<p>Roots (Hetu) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="roots-hetu">Roots (Hetu)</h3>
<p>There are six Roots: <strong>Greed, Hatred, Delusion, Non-Greed,
Non-Hatred, and Non-Delusion</strong>. Non-Delusion is the Wisdom
Cetasika. About Roots, it has been said in the Compendium of Roots in
the Third Chapter.</p>

<p>Jhāna Factors - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="jhāna-factors">Jhāna Factors</h3>
<p>There are seven Jhāna Factors: <strong>Initial Application
(<em>Vitakka</em>), Sustained Application (<em>Vicāra</em>), Zest
(<em>Pīti</em>), One-pointedness (<em>Ekaggatā</em>), Joy
(<em>Somanassa</em>), Displeasure (<em>Domanassa</em>), and Equanimity
(<em>Upekkhā</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>The mind directs to the object, goes towards the object, travels in
the object by the power of Jhāna Factors. Jhāna Factors are not needed
only for the Five Consciousnesses (<em>Pañca Viññāṇa</em>). Jhāna
Factors are not needed for those Cittas because they arise right there
taking the object impinged on the sensitivity. Except for the Two Sets
of Fivefold Sense Consciousness (<em>Dvipañca Viññāṇa</em>), Jhāna
Factors are obtained in all Cittas. Joy, Displeasure, and Equanimity—all
these three refer to the single Feeling (<em>Vedanā</em>) Cetasika.
Therefore, by way of Cetasika Dhammas, there are five Jhāna Factors:
Vitakka, Vicāra, Pīti, Ekaggatā, and Vedanā. Displeasure is an
Unwholesome Jhāna Factor. Others are common to both Wholesome and
Unwholesome sides.</p>
<hr />
<!-- Source: 8-2-3.html -->
<p>Path Factors - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="path-factors">Path Factors</h3>
<p>There are twelve Path Factors: <strong>Right View (<em>Sammā
Diṭṭhi</em>), Right Intention (<em>Sammā Saṅkappa</em>), Right Speech
(<em>Sammā Vācā</em>), Right Action (<em>Sammā Kammanta</em>), Right
Livelihood (<em>Sammā Ājīva</em>), Right Effort (<em>Sammā Vāyāma</em>),
Right Mindfulness (<em>Sammā Sati</em>), Right Concentration (<em>Sammā
Samādhi</em>), Wrong View (<em>Micchā Diṭṭhi</em>), Wrong Intention
(<em>Micchā Saṅkappa</em>), Wrong Effort (<em>Micchā Vāyāma</em>), and
Wrong Concentration (<em>Micchā Samādhi</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>Here, Right View is the Wisdom Cetasika. Right Intention is the
Vitakka Cetasika. Right Speech etc. three are the Abstinence Cetasikas.
Right Effort is the Energy Cetasika. Right Mindfulness is the Sati
Cetasika. Right Concentration is the One-pointedness Cetasika. Wrong
View is the Unwholesome Diṭṭhi Cetasika. Wrong Intention is the Vitakka
Cetasika applying in Unwholesome Cittas. Wrong Effort is the Energy
Cetasika applying in Unwholesome Cittas. Wrong Concentration is the
One-pointedness Cetasika in Unwholesome Cittas excluding the
Doubt-Associated Citta. It should be remembered that One-pointedness in
Doubt-Associated Cittas does not reach the state of Faculty or Power
either.</p>
<p>Here, since the three Cetasikas: Vitakka, Viriya, and Ekaggatā apply
in two places each, there are nine Path Factors by way of Dhamma. The
nine Cetasikas that are Path Factors are: Wisdom, Initial Application,
Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Energy, Mindfulness,
One-pointedness, and Wrong View.</p>
<p>Right View etc. Dhammas, grouped together, make the mind face towards
bad destinations and travel in the sphere of unwholesome, and make the
mind face towards good destinations and Nibbāna and travel in the sphere
of wholesome actions. Being parts of the paths leading to bad
destinations, good destinations, and Nibbāna, Right View etc. are called
Path Factors. Here, “Path” means the means/method.</p>
<p>In the kamma of killing, the four-factored Jhāna: Vitakka, Vicāra,
Domanassa, Ekaggatā is obtained, and the path consisting of three
factors: Wrong Intention, Wrong Effort, Wrong Concentration is also
obtained. Thus, how Jhāna and Path are obtained regarding all Wholesome
and Unwholesome actions should be understood according to the Cetasikas
applying in those respective Cittas.</p>

<p>Faculties - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="faculties-indriya">Faculties (Indriya)</h3>
<p>There are twenty-two Faculties: <strong>Eye Faculty
(<em>Cakkhundriya</em>), Ear Faculty (<em>Sotindriya</em>), Nose Faculty
(<em>Ghānindriya</em>), Tongue Faculty (<em>Jivhindriya</em>), Body
Faculty (<em>Kāyindriya</em>), Femininity Faculty
(<em>Itthindriya</em>), Masculinity Faculty (<em>Purisindriya</em>),
Life Faculty (<em>Jīvitindriya</em>), Mind Faculty
(<em>Manindriya</em>), Pleasure Faculty (<em>Sukhindriya</em>), Pain
Faculty (<em>Dukkhindriya</em>), Joy Faculty (<em>Somanassindriya</em>),
Displeasure Faculty (<em>Domanassindriya</em>), Equanimity Faculty
(<em>Upekkhindriya</em>), Faith Faculty (<em>Saddhindriya</em>), Energy
Faculty (<em>Viriyindriya</em>), Mindfulness Faculty
(<em>Satindriya</em>), Concentration Faculty (<em>Samādhindriya</em>),
Wisdom Faculty (<em>Paññindriya</em>), Faculty of “I will know the
unknown” (<em>Anaññātaññassāmitindriya</em>), Faculty of Knowledge
(<em>Aññindriya</em>), and Faculty of One Who Has Final Knowledge
(<em>Aññātāvindriya</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>Dhammas that exercise lordship over Dhammas connected with them are
Faculties. Exercising lordship means making them conform to oneself. The
aforementioned Eye etc. Dhammas are called “Faculties” because they
exercise lordship over Dhammas connected with them.</p>
<p>Eye Faculty is the Eye-sensitivity Rūpa. It is the lord of
Eye-Consciousness. Eye-Consciousness can arise only in accordance with
Eye-sensitivity. When Eye-sensitivity is very bright, an
Eye-Consciousness seeing the form well arises in accordance with it. If
the brightness of Eye-sensitivity decreases, an Eye-Consciousness not
seeing the object well arises in accordance with it. When there are eye
defects, objects appearing not as they are but small, large, or
different in color happens because Eye-Consciousness arises conforming
to Eye-sensitivity. Eye-Consciousness cannot arise surpassing the nature
of Eye-sensitivity without conforming to it. Since it makes
Eye-Consciousness conform to itself, Eye-sensitivity is a Faculty.</p>
<p>Ear Faculty is Ear-sensitivity.</p>
<p>Nose Faculty is Nose-sensitivity.</p>
<p>Tongue Faculty is Tongue-sensitivity.</p>
<p>Body Faculty is Body-sensitivity.</p>
<p>These four Faculties also exercise lordship over Ear, Nose, Tongue,
and Body consciousnesses respectively.</p>
<p>Femininity Faculty is the Femininity Material Phenomenon.</p>
<p>Masculinity Faculty is the Masculinity Material Phenomenon.</p>
<p>Sexual Rūpas exercise lordship over the complete Rūpa by imparting
female form and male form. There is also a difference in the ideas and
thoughts of men and women. The cause for that is also the two female and
male natures. Therefore, it must be said that the lordship of Sexual
Rūpas generally exists over the Five Aggregates.</p>
<p>Life Faculty is twofold as Rūpa and Arūpa. Life Faculty Rūpa is
Material Life Faculty. Life Faculty Cetasika is Immaterial Life Faculty.
Life Faculty Rūpa exercises lordship over Kamma-born Rūpas, and Life
Faculty Cetasika exercises lordship over Citta and Cetasikas. That
lordship is regarding maintaining the continuity for a long time.</p>
<p>Mind Faculty is Citta. Citta exercises lordship over Dhammas arising
together with it regarding cognizing the object.</p>
<p>Pleasure Faculty, Pain Faculty, Joy Faculty, Displeasure Faculty, and
Equanimity Faculty—these five are the single Feeling Cetasika by way of
Dhamma. The single Feeling Cetasika becomes differentiated as Pleasure
Faculty etc. by the mode of experiencing the object taste. Pleasure and
Displeasure feelings experience the object taste in a desirable mode.
Pain and Displeasure feelings experience the object taste in an
undesirable mode. Equanimity feeling experiences the object taste in a
neutral mode. Pleasure feelings etc. exercise lordship over associated
Dhammas in experiencing the object taste in respective modes.
‘Associated Dhammas’ refers to Citta and Cetasikas arising bound with
those respective feelings.</p>
<p>Faith Faculty is the Faith Cetasika.</p>
<p>Energy Faculty is the Energy Cetasika.</p>
<p>Mindfulness Faculty is the Mindfulness Cetasika.</p>
<p>Concentration Faculty is the One-pointedness Cetasika. (Excluding the
One-pointedness of the Doubt-Associated Citta.)</p>
<p>Wisdom Faculty is the Wisdom in mundane Cittas.</p>
<p>Of these five Dhammas, ‘Faith’ is lord over associated Dhammas
regarding placing trust in objects like Buddha etc. ‘Energy’ regarding
not retreating in action, ‘Mindfulness’ regarding not allowing what
should be done to be missed, ‘Concentration’ regarding establishing
firmly in the object, and ‘Wisdom’ regarding knowing the nature of the
object, exercise lordship over associated Dhammas.</p>
<p>‘Anaññātaññassāmitindriya’ is the wisdom of the Stream-Entry Path
Consciousness. The meaning of the word ‘Anaññātaññassāmitindriya’ is
‘the faculty of one exerting saying I will know what is not known’.
Since it is the knowledge arising due to that effort for the meditator
developing insight with the effort “I will know the Four Noble Truths
Dhamma or Nibbāna not known before ever,” the First Path Knowledge is
called Anaññātaññassāmitindriya.</p>
<p>‘Aññindriya’ is the wisdom in the six Supramundane Cittas from
Stream-Entry Fruit Consciousness to Arahant Path Consciousness. The
meaning of the word Aññindriya is ‘knowing faculty’. Although what was
not known before was known by the Stream-Entry Path Knowledge, since the
function of destroying defilements is not finished, what was known once
is seen again and again by these six knowledges.</p>
<p>‘Aññātāvindriya’ is the wisdom of the Arahant Fruit Consciousness.
The meaning of Aññātāvindriya is ‘the faculty of the one who has
finished knowing what should be known’.</p>
<p>Thus, although there are twenty-two Faculties, when taken as Dhamma,
since the five Feeling Faculties are the single Feeling Cetasika, and
the four Faculties ending with Wisdom Faculty are the single Wisdom
Cetasika, and the single Life Faculty becomes two Dhammas as Material
and Immaterial, there are sixteen Faculties by way of Dhamma.</p>
<p>The five Sensitive Rūpas, the two Sexual Rūpas, Life Rūpa, Life
Faculty Cetasika, Citta, Feeling, and the five Cetasikas: Faith, Energy,
Mindfulness, One-pointedness, Wisdom—these sixteen Dhammas are Faculty
Dhammas.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit of Knowing Faculties</strong></p>
<p>Those who do not know Ultimate Realities and their power
misunderstand the work done by Faculties as “work done by a soul
existing inside.” They misunderstand “Faculties themselves are the
soul.” Understanding Faculty Dhammas helps to understand that there is
no soul considered by the world as existing. To liberate the multitude
deluded thinking there is a soul, the Tathāgata preached these
twenty-two Faculties.</p>

<p>Powers (Bala) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="powers-bala">Powers (Bala)</h3>
<p>There are nine Power Dhammas: <strong>Faith Power (<em>Saddhā
Bala</em>), Energy Power (<em>Viriya Bala</em>), Mindfulness Power
(<em>Sati Bala</em>), Concentration Power (<em>Samādhi Bala</em>),
Wisdom Power (<em>Paññā Bala</em>), Shame Power (<em>Hiri Bala</em>),
Fear of Wrongdoing Power (<em>Ottappa Bala</em>), Shamelessness Power
(<em>Ahirika Bala</em>), and Fearlessness of Wrongdoing Power
(<em>Anottappa Bala</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>Because they suppress opposed Dhammas, and because they cannot be
shaken by opposed Dhammas, Faith etc. are called Powers. Views, Doubt
etc. are opposed to Faith. Since it cannot be shaken by those Dhammas,
Faith is a Power. Since it cannot be shaken by laziness, Energy is a
Power. Since it cannot be shaken by unwholesome Dhammas, Mindfulness is
a Power. Since it cannot be shaken by Restlessness, Concentration is a
Power. Concentration is One-pointedness. Since it cannot be shaken by
Delusion, Wisdom is a Power. Since it cannot be shaken by Shamelessness,
Shame is a Power. Since it cannot be shaken by Fearlessness of
Wrongdoing, Fear of Wrongdoing is a Power. Since it cannot be shaken by
Shame, Shamelessness is a Power. Since it cannot be shaken by Fear of
Wrongdoing, Fearlessness of Wrongdoing is a Power. In Cittas where the
Energy Cetasika does not apply, Power Dhammas are not obtained.</p>

<!-- Source: 8-2-6.html -->
<p>Predominants (Adhipati) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="predominants-adhipati">Predominants (Adhipati)</h3>
<p>There are four Predominant Dhammas: <strong>Predominance of Desire
(<em>Chandādhipati</em>), Predominance of Consciousness
(<em>Cittādhipati</em>), Predominance of Energy
(<em>Viriyādhipati</em>), and Predominance of Investigation
(<em>Vīmaṃsādhipati</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>Those who make others conform to themselves, those who handle others
according to their will, are Predominants. Dhammas that make Dhammas
associated with them conform to themselves are also called Predominants.
Desire etc. make Dhammas associated with them conform to themselves.
Therefore, those Dhammas are Predominants.</p>
<p>Predominance of Desire is the Desire Cetasika applying in Two-Rooted
and Three-Rooted Javanas.</p>
<p>Predominance of Consciousness is the Two-Rooted and Three-Rooted
Javana Consciousness.</p>
<p>Predominance of Energy is the Energy Cetasika applying in Two-Rooted
and Three-Rooted Javanas.</p>
<p>Predominance of Investigation is the Wisdom Cetasika. In Rootless and
One-Rooted Javana Cittas, and the Energy applying in them, do not reach
the state of Predominance. The two Cetasikas Desire and Wisdom do not
apply in Rootless and One-Rooted Javanas either.</p>
<p>Although all four: Desire, Consciousness, Energy, Investigation are
Predominant Dhammas, only one of them becomes Predominant at one time.
In some Cittas, all three: Desire, Energy, Investigation apply. However,
if Consciousness is Predominant at that time, none of the three
Cetasikas is Predominant. If Desire is Predominant at a certain time,
Consciousness, Energy, Investigation are not Predominant at that time.
The same applies when Energy and Investigation are Predominant.</p>
<p>The difference between Faculty and Predominant sides should also be
understood. Faculties also make other Dhammas conform to themselves.
Predominants also make other Dhammas conform to themselves. Of the two
sides, Faculty Dhammas exercise lordship only in the sphere of the
function performed by them. They do so while conforming to the
Predominant Dhamma. Therefore, Faculties are like subordinate kings.
Predominants are like emperors.</p>
<p>Predominance of Desire is the strong want to do something. Thinking
“if there is want, there is nothing that cannot be done,” for the person
who has put Desire forward, many Wholesome or Unwholesome Cittas with
Desire arise according to his intention as performing the wanted thing.
The Cittas arising thus and the Cetasikas applying in them are Dhammas
arising with Desire as Predominant. Consider how Consciousness etc.
become Predominant in this way.</p>

<p>Nutriments (Āhāra) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="nutriments-āhāra">Nutriments (Āhāra)</h3>
<p>There are four Nutriments: <strong>Edible Food (<em>Kabaḷiṅkāra
Āhāra</em>), Contact Nutriment (<em>Phassa Āhāra</em>), Mental Volition
Nutriment (<em>Manosañcetanā Āhāra</em>), and Consciousness Nutriment
(<em>Viññāṇa Āhāra</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>The meaning of the word Nutriment is ‘the cause producing a certain
result’. There are many causes producing various things. Among those
causes, the four starting with Edible Food are given the name
‘Nutriment’ because they are special causes for the arising and
existence of Name-and-Matter belonging to the internal continuity.</p>
<p><strong>Edible Food</strong> is the nutritive essence of the food
consumed. By it, Nutriment-born Matter is produced in the body. The
power of a paddy seed is main for producing the paddy plant. For the
growth of the arisen paddy plant and for maintaining it for months,
fertilizer and water are the main causes. Similarly, for beings living
by Edible Food, Kamma is main for producing Matter at Rebirth-Linking.
After that, Season and Nutriment are main for the growth and living for
some time of the being. The Kamma-born Rūpa lineage exists until death
by the support of Season and Nutriment. Season also can do its function
if the help of Nutriment is received. Therefore, the support of
Nutriment itself is main for the growth and living for some time of the
being. Therefore, Edible Food is preached as a special cause.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Nutriment</strong> is the Contact Cetasika. Feeling
is produced by it. Birds live by taking food with their beaks. If the
beak is lost, they will die without a way to take food. Similarly, these
beings obtain the taste of objects due to Contact, and by the arising of
Feelings, generate Craving and lengthen Saṃsāra. If there is no Contact,
Feeling and Craving cannot arise and Saṃsāra will be cut off. Contact is
a main cause for the continuity of Saṃsāra. Therefore, it is preached by
the name Nutriment.</p>
<p><strong>Mental Volition Nutriment</strong> is the Wholesome and
Unwholesome Volition. By it, Rebirth-Linking is produced in the three
existences: Sense, Fine-Material, and Immaterial. Birds fly from tree to
tree and live by finding food. Similarly, these beings continue Saṃsāra
going from existence to existence by the power of Kamma. If there is no
Kamma sending the being from existence to existence again and again, the
continuity of Saṃsāra will not happen. Kamma is also a special cause for
the uninterrupted existence of Saṃsāra. Therefore, the name Nutriment is
given to it too.</p>
<p><strong>Consciousness Nutriment</strong> is the Citta. By it, Name
Dhammas such as Contact, Feeling etc. and Kamma-born Rūpas are produced
at Rebirth-Linking. In the course of existence too, Mind-born Rūpas and
Cetasika Dhammas are produced by it. If there is no Consciousness,
Name-and-Matter will not arise and Saṃsāra will break. Consciousness is
also a main cause for the continuity of Saṃsāra. Therefore, the name
Nutriment is given to it too.</p>
<p>Of the four Nutriments, Edible Food is Material Nutriment. The
remaining three are Immaterial.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson 6</strong></p>
<p>Bodhi is a name for the Supramundane Path Wisdom. Dhammas helpful to
the Supramundane Path Wisdom are Requisites of Enlightenment
(<em>Bodhipakkhiya</em>). There are seven parts of Requisites of
Enlightenment: <strong>‘Foundations of Mindfulness

Means to Accomplishment (<em>Iddhipāda</em>) - Faculties
(<em>Indriya</em>) - Powers (<em>Bala</em>) - Factors of Enlightenment
(<em>Bojjhaṅga</em>) - Path Factors (<em>Maggāṅga</em>)’</strong>. Since
there are four Foundations of Mindfulness, four Supreme Efforts, four
Means to Accomplishment, five Faculties, five Powers, seven Factors of
Enlightenment, and eight Path Factors, there are thirty-seven Requisites
of Enlightenment separately.</p>

<p>Foundations of Mindfulness (Satipaṭṭhāna) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="foundations-of-mindfulness-satipaṭṭhāna">Foundations of
Mindfulness (Satipaṭṭhāna)</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Foundation of Mindfulness Contemplating the Body (<em>Kāyānupassanā
Satipaṭṭhāna</em>),</li>
<li>Foundation of Mindfulness Contemplating Feelings
(<em>Vedanānupassanā Satipaṭṭhāna</em>),</li>
<li>Foundation of Mindfulness Contemplating Consciousness
(<em>Cittānupassanā Satipaṭṭhāna</em>),</li>
<li>Foundation of Mindfulness Contemplating Mental Objects
(<em>Dhammānupassanā Satipaṭṭhāna</em>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus there are four Foundations of Mindfulness.</p>
<p>Mindfulness that is well established in objects such as the body so
that the mind cannot scatter in various objects is called Foundation of
Mindfulness. Although it is one by way of Dhamma, it has been preached
as four by way of objects such as the body where it is established.</p>
<p>Mindfulness maintained in the in-breath and out-breath and body parts
such as hair etc. is called Foundation of Mindfulness Contemplating the
Body.</p>
<p>Mindfulness maintained in the ninefold feelings is called Foundation
of Mindfulness Contemplating Feelings.</p>
<p>Mindfulness maintained in the consciousness which is sixteenfold as
with lust etc. is called Foundation of Mindfulness Contemplating
Consciousness.</p>
<p>Mindfulness maintained in Dhammas which are fivefold such as
Hindrances etc. is called Foundation of Mindfulness Contemplating Mental
Objects.</p>

<p>Supreme Efforts (Sammappadhāna) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="supreme-efforts-sammappadhāna">Supreme Efforts
(Sammappadhāna)</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>The effort to abandon arisen unwholesome states,</li>
<li>The effort to prevent unarisen unwholesome states from arising,</li>
<li>The effort to arise unarisen wholesome states,</li>
<li>The effort to develop arisen wholesome states,</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus there are four Supreme Efforts.</p>
<p>The powerful energy maintained thinking “Even if the blood in the
body dries up, the flesh withers away, and only bones, skin, and nerves
remain due to much exertion, I will not stop this effort to reach the
Supramundane Path” is Supreme Effort. Although that energy is one by way
of Dhamma, it has been preached as four Supreme Efforts according to the
functions performed by it.</p>
<p>If any sinful action has been done by oneself, the powerful energy
maintained in observing virtue and engaging in Calm and Insight
meditation so that such a sin will not be done again by oneself until
attaining Nibbāna is the first Supreme Effort.</p>
<p>The energy maintained in observing virtue and engaging in Calm and
Insight meditation so that sinful actions not known to have been done by
oneself, but known through seeing others doing, hearing, or from Dhamma
books, will never arise in one’s continuity, so that those sins will not
be done by oneself, is the second Supreme Effort.</p>
<p>Among wholesome Dhammas, the exertion made to generate Virtue, Calm
and Insight Meditation Wholesome states not yet arisen in one’s
continuity, or in other words, the energy maintained to generate
Purifications not obtained among the seven Purifications, is the third
Supreme Effort.</p>
<p>Even if the Worldling person has generated some virtue such as
morality, those virtues can decline by falling prey to defilements or by
arriving at another existence. The exertion made to reach the
Supramundane Path and make those virtues firm so that does not happen is
the fourth Supreme Effort.</p>

<h3 id="means-to-accomplishment-iddhipāda">Means to Accomplishment
(Iddhipāda)</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Desire as Means to Accomplishment (<em>Chandiddhipāda</em>)</li>
<li>Consciousness as Means to Accomplishment
(<em>Cittiddhipāda</em>)</li>
<li>Energy as Means to Accomplishment (<em>Viriyiddhipāda</em>)</li>
<li>Investigation as Means to Accomplishment
(<em>Vīmaṃsiddhipāda</em>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus there are four Means to Accomplishment.</p>
<p><em>Iddhi</em> means the accomplishment (success) of something. There
are manifold <em>Iddhis</em>. Among those <em>Iddhis</em>, in this talk
on Requisites of Enlightenment Dhammas, what is taken as <em>Iddhi</em>
is the group of Sublime and Supramundane Dhammas such as Jhāna, Direct
Knowledge, Path, and Fruit generated by meditation in the Buddha’s
Dispensation. <em>Iddhipāda</em> is said to these four Dhammas: Desire,
Consciousness, Energy, and Investigation, which are mainly helpful for
arriving at those <em>Iddhis</em>, for obtaining them.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to generate Sublime and Supramundane Dhammas
generated by yoga action or meditation power in the Buddha’s
Dispensation. They cannot be generated by weak Desire etc. Know that
<em>Iddhipādas</em> are the four Dhammas like Desire which have become
powerful by being Predominant, which cannot be destroyed even by a great
danger.</p>

<p>Faculties (Indriya) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="faculties-indriya-1">Faculties (Indriya)</h3>
<p><strong>Faith Faculty (<em>Saddhindriya</em>), Energy Faculty
(<em>Viriyindriya</em>), Mindfulness Faculty (<em>Satindriya</em>),
Concentration Faculty (<em>Samādhindriya</em>), Wisdom Faculty
(<em>Paññindriya</em>)</strong> are five Faculties. These five Faculties
were also mentioned in the twenty-two Faculties in the Compendium of
Mixed Categories. Faith is twofold: Ordinary Faith and Faith developed
by meditation. In the subject of Requisites of Enlightenment Dhammas,
Faith developed by meditation is taken as Faith Faculty. Similarly,
Energy Faculty etc. are also taken as Energy etc. developed by
meditation.</p>

<p>Factors of Enlightenment (Bojjhaṅga) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="factors-of-enlightenment-bojjhaṅga">Factors of Enlightenment
(Bojjhaṅga)</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Mindfulness Factor of Enlightenment (<em>Sati
Sambojjhaṅga</em>)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Investigation of Dhammas Factor of Enlightenment
(<em>Dhammavicaya Sambojjhaṅga</em>)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Energy Factor of Enlightenment (<em>Viriya
Sambojjhaṅga</em>)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Zest Factor of Enlightenment (<em>Pīti
Sambojjhaṅga</em>)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tranquillity Factor of Enlightenment (<em>Passaddhi
Sambojjhaṅga</em>)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Concentration Factor of Enlightenment (<em>Samādhi
Sambojjhaṅga</em>)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Equanimity Factor of Enlightenment (<em>Upekkhā
Sambojjhaṅga</em>)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus there are seven Factors of Enlightenment.</p>
<p>At the moment the Supramundane Path arises, these seven Dhammas
starting with Mindfulness and Investigation of Dhammas arising bound
with it are called <em>Bodhi</em> because they help to realize the Truth
well without deficiency, removing dangers such as shrinking and shaking
in the mind. The parts (limbs) of that group of Dhammas called
<em>Bodhi</em> are <em>Bojjhaṅgas</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Mindfulness Factor of Enlightenment</strong> is the
Mindfulness Cetasika mentioned by names like Foundations of Mindfulness.
It grows gradually in the meditator’s continuity by meditation and
arises bound with the Supramundane Path Consciousness at the moment it
arises, helping the realization of Truth.</p>
<p><strong>Investigation of Dhammas Factor of Enlightenment</strong> is
the Wisdom Cetasika. Since it analyzes well the Name and Form Dhammas
that are the ground for Insight by way of Impermanence etc., that wisdom
is called <em>Dhammavicaya</em>. That wisdom grows gradually regarding
formations that are the ground for Insight and becomes the Supramundane
Path Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Factor of Enlightenment</strong> is the powerful
Energy shown by the name Supreme Effort. It also grows gradually and
helps the realization of Truth at the moment of the Supramundane Path by
removing defilements that cause retreating and shrinking in wholesome
Dhammas.</p>
<p><strong>Zest Factor of Enlightenment</strong> is the Zest
(<em>Pīti</em>) Cetasika. It also grows by way of meditation regarding
formations that are the ground for Insight, removing the nature of not
being pleased in wholesome Dhammas, and helps the realization of Truth
at the Path moment.</p>
<p><strong>Tranquillity Factor of Enlightenment</strong> is the two
Tranquillities: Body and Mind Tranquillity. In meditating, it grows
gradually, removing the burning and heating nature in the mind, bringing
it to a peaceful, cool nature, and helps the realization of Truth at the
Supramundane Path moment.</p>
<p><strong>Concentration Factor of Enlightenment</strong> is the
One-pointedness Cetasika. It also grows gradually by meditation,
removing the unsettledness in the mind, and helps the realization of
Truth.</p>
<p><strong>Equanimity Factor of Enlightenment</strong> is the Neutrality
of Mind (<em>Tatramajjhattatā</em>) Cetasika. It also grows gradually by
meditation, completely removing the shrinking and shaking nature in the
mind, and helps the realization of Truth at the Path moment.</p>

<p>Path Factors (Maggāṅga) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="path-factors-maggāṅga">Path Factors (Maggāṅga)</h3>
<p>The eight Dhammas: <strong>Right View, Right Intention, Right Speech,
Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right
Concentration</strong> are Path Factors.</p>
<p>Destruction of defilements and seeing Nibbāna are done by these eight
Dhammas starting with Right View arising bound with one Citta at once by
way of Supramundane nature. Here in Path Factors, the word “Path”
(<em>Magga</em>) refers to the meaning “Means/Strategy.” It is the means
of destroying defilements and seeing Nibbāna. The word “Factor”
(<em>Aṅga</em>) refers to the meaning “Limb/Part.” The parts of the
means of destroying defilements and seeing Nibbāna are Path Factors. In
this Supramundane Path, there are four states. Those states are named in
order as Stream-Entry Path, Once-Returning Path, Non-Returning Path, and
Arahant Path. Know the eight Path Factors as stated in the Compendium of
Mixed Categories.</p>
<p>These Requisites of Enlightenment Dhammas, which are thirty-seven by
way of division, become fourteen by way of Ultimate Realities:
Mindfulness, Energy, Desire, Consciousness, Wisdom, Faith,
One-pointedness, Zest, Tranquillity, Neutrality of Mind, Initial
Application, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood.</p>
<p>Of these fourteen Dhammas, the nine Dhammas: Initial Application,
Tranquillity, Zest, Neutrality of Mind, Desire, Consciousness, and the
three Abstinences appeared in only one place each. Energy, which is one
Dhamma, appears in nine places: four Supreme Efforts, Energy Means to
Accomplishment, Energy Faculty, Energy Power, Energy Factor of
Enlightenment, Right Effort. Mindfulness, which is one Dhamma, appears
in eight places: four Foundations of Mindfulness, Mindfulness Faculty,
Mindfulness Power, Mindfulness Factor of Enlightenment, Right
Mindfulness. One-pointedness appears in four places: Concentration
Faculty, Concentration Power, Concentration Factor of Enlightenment,
Right Concentration. Wisdom Cetasika appears in five places:
Investigation Means to Accomplishment, Wisdom Faculty, Wisdom Power,
Investigation of Dhammas Factor of Enlightenment, Right View. Faith
Cetasika appears in two places: Faith Faculty, Faith Power.</p>
<p>All these Requisites of Enlightenment Dhammas are generally obtained
in all Supramundane Cittas. In Supramundane Cittas starting with Second
Jhāna, Right Intention is not obtained. In Fourth Jhāna and Fifth Jhāna
Supramundane Cittas, both Right Intention and Zest Factor of
Enlightenment are not obtained. When developing Purifications with the
hope of arriving at the Supramundane Path, Requisites of Enlightenment
Dhammas are obtained appropriately in Mundane Cittas as well. Requisites
of Enlightenment Dhammas are not obtained all at once in Mundane
Consciousness as in Supramundane Consciousness.</p>

<p>The Five Aggregates - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="the-five-aggregates">The Five Aggregates</h3>
<p><strong>Lesson 8</strong></p>
<p>There are five Aggregates: <strong>Aggregate of Materiality
(<em>Rūpakkhandha</em>), Aggregate of Feeling (<em>Vedanākkhandha</em>),
Aggregate of Perception (<em>Saññākkhandha</em>), Aggregate of Mental
Formations (<em>Saṅkhārakkhandha</em>), and Aggregate of Consciousness
(<em>Viññāṇakkhandha</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>Aggregate of Materiality is the twenty-eight Rūpas shown in the
Matter Chapter. Taking all Rūpas divided as past etc. together by way of
Rūpa nature as one group, the name Aggregate of Materiality is given to
all of them. The meaning of the word <em>Khandha</em> (Aggregate) is
group. The group of Rūpas is the Aggregate of Materiality.</p>
<p>Aggregate of Feeling is the Feeling Cetasika which is one of the
fifty-two Cetasikas. Taking all feelings which are manifold as past etc.
together by way of Feeling nature in the mind, all are called the
Aggregate of Feeling.</p>
<p>Aggregate of Perception is the Perception Cetasika. Taking all
perceptions which are manifold as past etc. together by way of
Perception nature in the mind, all are called the Aggregate of
Perception.</p>
<p>Aggregate of Mental Formations is the fifty Cetasikas excluding
Feeling and Perception. Taking that Cetasika group which is manifold as
past etc. as one group by way of Formation nature in the mind, it is
called the Aggregate of Mental Formations.</p>
<p>Aggregate of Consciousness is the eighty-nine Cittas. Taking the
Consciousness group which is manifold as past etc. as one group by way
of Consciousness, it is called the Aggregate of Consciousness.</p>
<p>Of the four Ultimate Realities, all except Nibbāna belong to the Five
Aggregates. Since Nibbāna exists as a single Dhamma without distinction
as past etc., there is no group of Nibbāna. Therefore, it is not
included in the Compendium of Aggregates.</p>
<p>The word <em>Saṅkhāra</em> (Formation/Construction) is used in
several meanings. In the verse “<em>Aniccā vata saṅkhārā</em>,” what is
meant by Saṅkhāra is the thing produced by conditions. Since everything
belonging to the Five Aggregates are Dhammas produced by conditions, the
“Saṅkhāra” word in “<em>Aniccā vata saṅkhārā</em>” refers to the Five
Aggregates themselves. Where it is said Aggregate of Mental Formations
(<em>Saṅkhārakkhandha</em>), what is taken by the name Saṅkhāra are the
fifty Cetasikas other than Feeling and Perception. To prevent confusion
of facts, these two meanings referred to by the word Saṅkhāra should be
kept in mind.</p>
<p>The group of Name and Form Dhammas is divided into five parts thus as
Form, Feeling etc. to make it easier to eliminate the perception of Self
(<em>Atta Saññā</em>). The perception of Self arises separately in the
five parts starting with Form. “I am beautiful, I am tall, short, fat”
etc.—Self perception arises in Form. “I feel pleasure, I feel pain, it
is I who feel pleasure and pain” etc.—Feeling is taken as Self. “I know
such and such things, it is I who know” etc.—Perception is taken as Self
by way of considering. “It is I who give, I who take, I who go, I who
attach, I who get angry” etc.—Mental Formations are taken as Self. “I
see, I hear” etc.—Consciousness is taken as Self. When ordinary people
understand that what they take as Self are Dhammas like Form etc., the
perception of Self is eliminated. The benefit of knowing the Five
Aggregates is the ability to eliminate the perception of Self.</p>
<p><strong>The Five Aggregates of Clinging
(<em>Upādānakkhandha</em>)</strong></p>
<p>There are five Aggregates of Clinging: <strong>Materiality Aggregate
of Clinging (<em>Rūpupādānakkhandha</em>), Feeling Aggregate of Clinging
(<em>Vedanupādānakkhandha</em>), Perception Aggregate of Clinging
(<em>Saññupādānakkhandha</em>), Mental Formations Aggregate of Clinging
(<em>Saṅkhārupādānakkhandha</em>), and Consciousness Aggregate of
Clinging (<em>Viññāṇupādānakkhandha</em>)</strong>. Craving and View
taking Form etc. as “mine” and “I” firmly are Clinging
(<em>Upādāna</em>). The entire Five Aggregates are not caught by the
grasping of Clinging. What are caught by the grasping of Clinging, what
become places for the existence of Clinging, are Mundane Dhammas.
Supramundane Dhammas are not caught by Clinging. To escape from Saṃsāra
suffering, Clinging must be eliminated. They can be eliminated by
observing with insight the Fine-Material and Immaterial Dhammas that are
places for the growth of Clinging. Both Dhammas caught by Clinging and
not caught by Clinging belong to the Five Aggregates. The five
Aggregates of Clinging are preached to separate and show the Dhammas
that should be taken for Insight.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Materiality Aggregate of Clinging is the twenty-eight Rūpas. Since
Rūpas are Mundane, all become places for Clinging.</li>
<li>Feeling Aggregate of Clinging is the Feeling Cetasika in the
eighty-one Mundane Cittas.</li>
<li>Perception Aggregate of Clinging is the Perception Cetasika in the
eighty-one Mundane Cittas.</li>
<li>Mental Formations Aggregate of Clinging is the remaining fifty
Cetasikas applying in Mundane Cittas.</li>
<li>Consciousness Aggregate of Clinging is the eighty-one Mundane
Cittas.</li>

<p>The Twelve Bases - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="the-twelve-bases">The Twelve Bases</h3>
<p><strong>Lesson 9</strong></p>
<p>There are twelve Bases (<em>Āyatana</em>): <strong>Eye Base
(<em>Cakkhāyatana</em>), Ear Base (<em>Sotāyatana</em>), Nose Base
(<em>Ghānāyatana</em>), Tongue Base (<em>Jivhāyatana</em>), Body Base
(<em>Kāyāyatana</em>), Mind Base (<em>Manāyatana</em>), Form Base
(<em>Rūpāyatana</em>), Sound Base (<em>Saddāyatana</em>), Smell Base
(<em>Gandhāyatana</em>), Taste Base (<em>Rasāyatana</em>), Tangible Base
(<em>Phoṭṭhabbāyatana</em>), and Mental Object Base
(<em>Dhammāyatana</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>Eye Base is Eye-sensitivity. Ear, Nose, Tongue, Body Bases are also
those respective Sensitive Rūpas. Mind Base is the eighty-nine Cittas.
Form Base is Color Rūpa. Sound Base is Sound Rūpa. Smell Base is Smell
Rūpa. Taste Base is Taste Rūpa. Tangible Base is the three Great
Essential Rūpas: Earth, Fire, Air. Mental Object Base is the fifty-two
Cetasikas, the sixteen Subtle Rūpas, and Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Of these twelve Bases, the six starting with Eye Base are called
Internal Bases. The six starting with Form Base are called External
Bases.</p>
<p>What are shown by the name Base are also the Ultimate Realities shown
by the name Aggregate. The only difference is including Nibbāna in the
Base classification. The group of Ultimate Realities is divided into
twelve by the name Base according to the functioning of Citta and
Cetasikas. In Eye Base and Form Base, Eye-door Citta and Cetasikas
function. In Ear Base and Sound Base, Ear-door Citta and Cetasikas
function. In Nose Base and Smell Base, Nose-door Citta and Cetasikas
function. In Tongue Base and Taste Base, Tongue-door Citta and Cetasikas
function. In Body Base and Tangible Base, Body-door Citta and Cetasikas
function. In Mind Base and Mental Object Base, Mind-door Citta and
Cetasikas function. Eye-sensitivity etc. are called Bases in the sense
that they are places where Citta and Cetasikas function. Places where
Citta and Cetasikas arise and perform functions belonging to them are
called Bases.</p>
<p>Some hold firmly to Name (<em>Nāma</em>) Dhammas performing actions
like knowing, tasting, recognizing, enjoying, opposing, etc., as Self.
Their Identity View (<em>Sakkāya Diṭṭhi</em>) is not eliminated by
observing with insight by the Aggregate method. By observing with
insight by the Base method, their Identity View is eliminated.
Therefore, for them, the group of Ultimate Realities is divided into
twelve parts as Bases.</p>

<p>The Eighteen Elements - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="the-eighteen-elements">The Eighteen Elements</h3>
<p>There are eighteen Elements (<em>Dhātu</em>): <strong>Eye Element
(<em>Cakkhu Dhātu</em>), Ear Element (<em>Sota Dhātu</em>), Nose Element
(<em>Ghāna Dhātu</em>), Tongue Element (<em>Jivhā Dhātu</em>), Body
Element (<em>Kāya Dhātu</em>), Form Element (<em>Rūpa Dhātu</em>), Sound
Element (<em>Sadda Dhātu</em>), Smell Element (<em>Gandha Dhātu</em>),
Taste Element (<em>Rasa Dhātu</em>), Tangible Element (<em>Phoṭṭhabba
Dhātu</em>), Eye-Consciousness Element (<em>Cakkhu-viññāṇa Dhātu</em>),
Ear-Consciousness Element (<em>Sota-viññāṇa Dhātu</em>),
Nose-Consciousness Element (<em>Ghāna-viññāṇa Dhātu</em>),
Tongue-Consciousness Element (<em>Jivhā-viññāṇa Dhātu</em>),
Body-Consciousness Element (<em>Kāya-viññāṇa Dhātu</em>), Mind Element
(<em>Mano Dhātu</em>), Mind-Consciousness Element (<em>Mano-viññāṇa
Dhātu</em>), and Mental Object Element (<em>Dhamma
Dhātu</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>The meaning of the word <em>Dhātu</em> is ‘a thing that is not a
being, not a person’. Since Eye-sensitivity itself is a nature that is
not a being or person, it is called Eye Element. Ear Element etc. are
also Ear etc. Sensitive Rūpas themselves. Since Color Rūpa itself is not
a being or person, it is called Form Element. Sound, Smell, Taste,
Tangible Elements are also Sound, Smell, Taste, Tangible respectively.
The single Mind Base is divided into seven Elements here.</p>
<p>Of the eighty-nine Cittas, the two Eye-Consciousnesses are the
Eye-Consciousness Element. The two Ear-Consciousnesses are the
Ear-Consciousness Element. The two Nose-Consciousnesses are the
Nose-Consciousness Element. The two Tongue-Consciousnesses are the
Tongue-Consciousness Element. The two Body-Consciousnesses are the
Body-Consciousness Element. The three Cittas: Five-door Adverting and
the two Receiving Cittas are the Mind Element. The remaining seventy-six
Cittas are the Mind-Consciousness Element. The fifty-two Cetasikas,
sixteen Subtle Rūpas, and Nibbāna are the Mental Object Element
(<em>Dhamma Dhātu</em>).</p>
<p>What are divided into eighteen as Elements are also the same group of
Dhammas divided into twelve as Bases. In the Element classification, the
single Mind Base is divided into seven as Eye-Consciousness Element,
Ear-Consciousness Element, Nose-Consciousness Element,
Tongue-Consciousness Element, Body-Consciousness Element, Mind Element,
and Mind-Consciousness Element. That is the difference between the two
parts: Base and Element. Some have a strong perception of Self in
Consciousness (<em>Viññāṇa</em>). Their perception of Self is not
eliminated by observing with insight by the Base method which lacks
analysis of Consciousness. Therefore, for those who have strong
perception of Self in Consciousness, to make it easy for them to
eliminate their perception of Self, this Element analysis, which further
analyzes Consciousness, is preached.</p>

<p>The Four Noble Truths - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="the-four-noble-truths">The Four Noble Truths</h3>
<p><strong>Lesson 10</strong></p>
<p>There are four Noble Truths: <strong>Noble Truth of Suffering
(<em>Dukkha Ariya Sacca</em>), Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering
(<em>Dukkha Samudaya Ariya Sacca</em>), Noble Truth of the Cessation of
Suffering (<em>Dukkha Nirodha Ariya Sacca</em>), and Noble Truth of the
Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering (<em>Dukkha Nirodha Gāminī
Paṭipadā Ariya Sacca</em>)</strong>.</p>
<p>The thing that definitely exists, exists in that very way, and does
not become otherwise, is called Truth (<em>Sacca</em>). Not stopping
just by saying Truth, the word “Noble” (<em>Ariya</em>) is placed at the
beginning and these Truths are named “Noble Truths” because of several
reasons. Some truth is true in one way, but becomes untrue when looked
at in another way. There is no becoming untrue in any way in the four
Truths like Suffering etc. preached by the Buddha. The Truth that does
not change in any way is the supreme Truth among truths. Here, the word
“Noble” is placed at the beginning of the word Truth to show the
supremacy of these Truths. Supreme Truth is Noble Truth.</p>
<p>These four Truths were proclaimed by the Buddha. Since he is
worshipped by the world including gods, the Buddha is called Noble
(<em>Ariya</em>). Since these Truths are ones seen and proclaimed to the
world by the Noble Buddha, they belong to the Buddha. In the sense that
they are the Truths of the Noble One, they are called Noble Truths.</p>
<p>If someone realizes these four Truths, that person transcends the
state of worldling and arrives at the state of a Noble Person. Since
they lead the person who realizes them to the Noble state, they are also
called Noble Truths.</p>
<p><strong>Noble Truth of Suffering</strong></p>
<p>The eighty-one Mundane Cittas, the fifty-one Cetasikas other than
Greed, and the twenty-eight Rūpas—this group of Dhammas belongs to the
Truth of Suffering.</p>
<p>The suffering of birth, the suffering of decay, the suffering of
death, the suffering of having to grieve and weep due to loss of
relatives etc., the suffering of excessive mental fatigue due to loss of
relatives etc., the suffering of association with the unpleasant, the
suffering of separation from the loved, the suffering of not getting
what one wants—all these arise, all these are based on the group of
Dhammas said to belong to the Truth of Suffering. Among those Dhammas,
there is not a single Dhamma free from these three: Birth, Decay, Death.
Therefore, that group of Dhammas is definitely suffering. Because they
are definitely suffering, they are called the Truth of Suffering.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because the person who is attached to that mass of
Formations called the Truth of Suffering suffers from these three
sufferings: Suffering of Formations (<em>Saṅkhāra Dukkha</em>),
Suffering of Change (<em>Vipariṇāma Dukkha</em>), and Suffering of
Suffering (<em>Dukkha Dukkha</em>), those Dhammas are definitely
suffering.</p>
<p>Of those three sufferings, <strong>Suffering of Formations</strong>
is the suffering arising regarding initially producing something and
regarding maintaining it. To be born as a human in the human world,
there must be some merit. Without merit, a human Five Aggregates cannot
be obtained. Therefore, the person who wishes to obtain it must do merit
for it. Having to do merit is one suffering arising regarding human Five
Aggregates. Even if merit is done, if many sins are committed, it is not
obtained. Therefore, one must abstain from sin. Abstaining from sin is
also not an easy matter. Having to abstain from sin is also one
suffering arising regarding producing human Five Aggregates. After being
born in the human world, human life is not preserved automatically. To
prevent it from perishing and to maintain it, one must toil much to
provide food and drink and to protect it. That toiling is the suffering
existing regarding maintaining life after birth. All that is the
Suffering of Formations produced by human Five Aggregates.</p>
<p><strong>Suffering of Change</strong> is the suffering resulting from
the decay and breaking up of arisen formations. No matter how this human
Five Aggregates is nourished, it decays and changes. It can perish by
not receiving food etc. in required amount, or by not receiving
requisites as needed, or by coming to death due to some other danger.
Someday, by the expiration of lifespan, it comes to death and is
completely destroyed. That cannot be prevented by any power. When
disease etc. factors capable of destroying the Five Aggregates are seen,
one has to toil much to protect it. When signs of destruction are seen,
great fear and grief also arise. All that is Suffering of Change
regarding human Five Aggregates.</p>
<p>Bodily painful feelings arising in various places of the body due to
various reasons from time to time, and mental painful feelings arising
due to various reasons, are <strong>Suffering of Suffering</strong>. In
one lifetime, many such sufferings arise. If there is no human Five
Aggregates, not even one of those sufferings arises. Therefore, it must
be said that all those sufferings are produced by the human Five
Aggregates themselves. That threefold suffering is produced similarly by
other Five Aggregates as well. All formations said above to belong to
the Truth of Suffering produce the threefold suffering for the person
attached to them because of them. Therefore, that mass of formations
becomes the true suffering or the Truth of Suffering.</p>
<p><strong>Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering</strong></p>
<p>The true cause of the arising of suffering is the Noble Truth of the
Origin of Suffering. That is <strong>Craving (<em>Taṇhā</em>)</strong>.
The craving intended here is the nature of taking the Five Aggregates as
a good thing, as a place where happiness exists, and attaching to it. As
long as that craving exists unabandoned, the being acts to maintain the
obtained Five Aggregates and to obtain future Five Aggregates. It is to
those actions that “Kamma” is said. As long as the being performs Kamma,
he receives Five Aggregates again and again. As long as Five Aggregates
are received, the being is not freed from the three mentioned
sufferings. Therefore, that Craving is called the true cause of
producing suffering.</p>
<p><strong>Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nibbāna</strong> is the Noble Truth of the Cessation of
Suffering. As long as the Five Aggregates exist, the mentioned three
kinds of suffering also exist. The three kinds of suffering do not exist
when the Five Aggregates are extinguished. Therefore, the cessation of
the Five Aggregates is called the <strong>Noble Truth of the Cessation
of Suffering</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of
Suffering</strong></p>
<p>The eight Path Factors: Right View, Right Intention, Right Speech,
Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and
Right Concentration arising in the Supramundane Path Consciousness are
the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering. Since
suffering returns again and again as long as Craving exists, the only
path to escape from suffering is the destruction of Craving which
produces suffering. The mentioned Supramundane Path arises destroying
that Craving. The only thing having the power to destroy Craving is that
Eightfold Path. Therefore, it is called the <strong>Noble Truth of the
Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering</strong>. (It should also be
noted that wherever “Five Aggregates” was mentioned here, it referred
only to Mundane Dhammas.)</p>
<p><strong>Briefly, the Four Noble Truths</strong></p>
<p>The eighty-one Mundane Cittas, the fifty-one Cetasikas, and the
twenty-eight Rūpas—these are the <strong>Truth of Suffering</strong>.
Craving, or the Greed Cetasika, is the <strong>Truth of Origin</strong>.
Nibbāna is the <strong>Truth of Cessation</strong>. The eight Path
Factors such as Right View etc. applying in the four Supramundane
Wholesome Cittas are the <strong>Truth of the Path</strong>.</p>
<p>The four Supramundane Wholesome Cittas, the Cetasikas in them other
than the eight Path Factors, the four Fruit Cittas, and the Cetasikas
applying in them—these Dhammas are not included in the Compendium of
Truths. They do not belong to the Four Noble Truths.</p>
<p><strong>Thus ends the Seventh Chapter named Compendium of
Categories.</strong></p>

<p>The group of Ultimate Realities: the eighty-nine Cittas, fifty-two
Cetasikas, and twenty-eight Rūpas, which are the fundamental elements
making up the multitude of beings such as Devas and humans and all
objects, were analyzed and shown in various ways in the previous seven
chapters. Now you must investigate this matter: Do those Ultimate
Realities arise spontaneously? Or does some powerful being create them?
How do they arise?</p>
<p>The Ultimate Realities of Citta, Cetasika, and Rūpa arise from
various causes. Therefore, they are called <strong>Conditioned
Dhammas</strong> (<em>Saṅkhata Dhamma</em>) and
<strong>Formations</strong> (<em>Saṅkhāra</em>). The Ultimate Reality of
Nibbāna is not something arising from conditions. Therefore, it is
called the <strong>Unconditioned Element</strong> (<em>Asaṅkhata
Dhātu</em>).</p>
<p>The causes that produce Formations (Saṅkhāra Dhammas) are also called
<strong>Conditions</strong> (<em>Paccaya</em>). The Buddha has preached
the causes for the arising of Formations in three methods: the
<strong>Noble Truth Method</strong>, the <strong>Dependent Origination
(<em>Paṭicca Samuppāda</em>) Method</strong>, and the
<strong>Conditional Relations (<em>Paṭṭhāna</em>) Method</strong>. Of
these, the Noble Truth Method is the very brief method. The Dependent
Origination Method is the medium method. The Conditional Relations
Method is the detailed method.</p>
<p>Since the analysis of Noble Truths was stated in the Seventh Chapter,
what remains to be explained in this Section on Conditions are the
Dependent Origination Method and the Conditional Relations Method.</p>
<p>The cause-and-effect method that teaches how Saṃsāra exists
uninterruptedly by Dhammas arising due to other Dhammas, such as “When
Ignorance exists, Formations arise due to Ignorance; when Formations
exist, Consciousness arises due to them,” is the <strong>Dependent
Origination Method</strong>. It is preached in the Vibhaṅga Pakaraṇa of
the Abhidhamma Piṭaka.</p>
<p>The cause-and-effect method preached in the Paṭṭhāna Mahā Pakaraṇa is
the <strong>Conditional Relations Method</strong>. In the teaching of
Dependent Origination, only the arising of Formations etc. due to
Ignorance etc. is taught; it is not taught that “Ignorance has these
specific powers/forces; among those powers, Ignorance conditions
Formations or produces Formations by such and such powers in such and
such ways.” In the Paṭṭhāna, the Conditioning Forces (<em>Paccaya
Satti</em>) existing in all Dhammas, both Ultimate and non-Ultimate, and
the manner in which respective Dhammas condition respective Dhammas by
various forces such as Root, Object, etc., are taught. A complete
knowledge of the Buddha’s Dhamma is obtained by learning both these
methods. The brief method of these two is the Dependent Origination
Method. Therefore, the Dependent Origination Method will be explained
here first. For the person learning it, it is useful to first memorize
the Dependent Origination Pali Text. Memorize it. It is as follows:</p>

</ol>
<p>Thus is the arising of this entire mass of suffering.</p>
<p>From here on, these clauses showing Dependent Origination will be
explained in order.</p>
<p><strong><em>Avijjā paccayā saṅkhārā</em></strong> <strong>Conditioned
by Ignorance, Formations come to be.</strong></p>
<p>Here, <strong>Ignorance (<em>Avijjā</em>)</strong> is the Delusion
(<em>Moha</em>) that covers the four facts: Suffering, the Cause of
Suffering, the Cessation of Suffering, and the Path leading to the
Cessation of Suffering.</p>
<p><strong>Formations (<em>Saṅkhāra</em>)</strong> are the Mundane
Wholesome and Unwholesome Volitions. The group of Wholesome and
Unwholesome Volitions is divided into three parts: Meritorious
Formations (<em>Puññābhisaṅkhāra</em>), Demeritorious Formations
(<em>Apuññābhisaṅkhāra</em>), and Imperturbable Formations
(<em>Āneñjābhisaṅkhāra</em>). The eight Sense-Sphere Wholesome Volitions
and the five Fine-Material Wholesome Volitions are called Meritorious
Formations. The twelve Unwholesome Volitions are called Demeritorious
Formations. The four Immaterial Wholesome Volitions are called
Imperturbable Formations. Since Immaterial Wholesome associated with
strong concentration is not easily shaken, it is called Imperturbable
Formation. Saṅkhāra is also threefold as Body Formation, Verbal
Formation, and Mental Formation.</p>
<p>The person with Ignorance, wrongly understanding this Saṃsāra, which
is a mass of suffering, as happiness, performs various sins to maintain
his existence and to please himself. He performs merits for happiness in
future lives. If there were no Ignorance, those merits and demerits
would not be done. Therefore, it is said that conditioned by Ignorance,
Formations arise.</p>
<p>Among these Ultimate Realities, there is no Formation arising from a
single cause. Whatever arises, arises from many causes. In this
Dependent Origination, Ignorance alone is shown as the cause of
Formations to indicate the main cause. In other places too, one cause is
shown to indicate the main cause.</p>
<p>Here, a question may arise: “How can Wholesome arise from Delusion
(<em>Moha</em>), which is exclusively Unwholesome and opposed to it?”
There is no rule that cause and effect must be similar. From mud, which
is foul-smelling and ugly, the fragrant and colorful lotus arises. From
fire, which is very bright, dark smoke arises. Therefore, it should be
accepted that Wholesome can arise even from Unwholesome which is opposed
to Wholesome.</p>
<p><strong><em>Saṅkhāra paccayā viññāṇaṃ</em></strong>
<strong>Conditioned by Formations, Consciousness comes to
be.</strong></p>
<p>The thirty-two Mundane Resultant Cittas are the <strong>Consciousness
(<em>Viññāṇa</em>)</strong> arising conditioned by Formations.
Supramundane Results are not taken here. Mundane Results are of two
parts: Rebirth-Linking Result and Course of Existence Result. Among
Formations, the Restlessness-Associated Volition is not a condition for
Rebirth-Linking Results. The Direct Knowledge (<em>Abhiññā</em>)
Volition is not a condition for even a single Resultant Consciousness.
It was stated in the Fifth Chapter that Restlessness-Associated Volition
does not give Rebirth-Linking Results. The nature of Direct Knowledge
Volition can be known from the Meditation Subject section.</p>
<p>The arising of Resultant Consciousness conditioned by Formations is a
deep matter. If Resultant Consciousness arises without a Kamma, every
Resultant Consciousness should arise for everyone. Resultant
Consciousness connected to respective Kammas does not arise for others,
but only for those who performed those respective Kammas. From that, it
should be understood that if there is no Kamma, Resultant Consciousness
does not arise. Since Resultant Consciousness arises only when Kamma
exists, it can be known that Kamma is a condition for Resultant
Consciousness.</p>
<p><strong><em>Viññāṇa paccayā nāmarūpaṃ</em></strong>
<strong>Conditioned by Consciousness, Name-and-Matter comes to
be.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Name (<em>Nāma</em>)</strong> arising from the condition of
Consciousness refers to the Cetasikas arising bound with those
respective Consciousnesses. The fifty-two Cetasikas and the
Name-and-Matter arising from the four conditions Kamma etc. are the
<strong>Name-and-Matter (<em>Nāma-Rūpa</em>)</strong> arising from the
condition of Consciousness. Understand the Name-and-Matter that can
arise due to respective Consciousnesses according to facts stated in
previous chapters separately.</p>
<p>Only Resultant Consciousness arises from the condition of Formations.
Wholesome, Unwholesome, and Functional Consciousnesses are also
conditions for Name-and-Matter. Therefore, know that the Consciousness
arising from the condition of Formations is Resultant Consciousness, and
the Consciousness that is a condition for Name-and-Matter includes all
Resultant and Non-Resultant Consciousnesses.</p>
<p>Rebirth-Linking Consciousness is a condition only for Names and
Kamma-born Matter. Course of Existence Consciousness is a condition for
Names and all Matter.</p>
<p>The arising of Name-and-Matter from the condition of Consciousness
should be understood according to existence (<em>bhava</em>). In both
Sense and Fine-Material existences, both Name and Matter arise from the
condition of Consciousness. In Immaterial existence, only Name arises
from the condition of Consciousness. In Asañña existence, there is no
Consciousness. There, only Matter arises by the power of Kamma
Consciousness belonging to the past existence.</p>
<p>If Consciousness does not appear, the appearance of Name-and-Matter
does not occur. From that, know that the appearance of Name-and-Matter
is due to Consciousness. Just as light arises from it when fire arises,
know that Name-and-Matter also arises from it when Consciousness
arises.</p>
<p><strong><em>Nāmarūpa paccayā saḷāyatanaṃ</em></strong>
<strong>Conditioned by Name-and-Matter, the Six Sense Bases come to
be.</strong></p>
<p>It was stated above that there are twelve Bases. Of those twelve
Bases, the six Bases: Eye Base, Ear Base, Nose Base, Tongue Base, Body
Base, and Mind Base are taken here.</p>
<p>The word <strong>Name (<em>Nāma</em>)</strong> refers to the three
Ultimate Realities: Citta, Cetasika, and Nibbāna. Here, by
<em>Nāma</em>, the fifty-two Cetasikas are taken. By <strong>Matter
(<em>Rūpa</em>)</strong>, the eleven: four Great Essentials, six Base
Rūpas, and Life Faculty Rūpa belonging to each continuity are taken. In
some books, twelve Rūpas including Nutriment Rūpa are taken.</p>
<p>The arising of Six Sense Bases from the condition of Name-and-Matter
should also be understood analytically. Since there is no Matter in the
Immaterial Plane, only the Mind Base arises there with Name alone as
condition. In the Sense Plane, all six Bases appear with both Name and
Matter as conditions. In the Fine-Material Plane, three Bases: Eye Base,
Ear Base, and Mind Base appear with both Name and Matter as conditions.
In the Asañña Plane, not even one of these six Bases appears. The five
Base Rūpas Eye etc., which belong to the Six Sense Bases, are included
in the condition group here because the Mind Base appears due to Base
Matter. The appearance of Six Sense Bases is simply the development of
Name-and-Matter. In a small fruit bud, there is no shell, kernel, or
water. When it grows, they arise. The arising of Six Sense Bases of
Name-and-Matter should be understood similarly.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 3</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Saḷāyatana paccayā phasso</em></strong>
<strong>Conditioned by the Six Sense Bases, Contact comes to
be.</strong></p>
<p>Here, <strong>Contact (<em>Phassa</em>)</strong> is the Contact
Cetasika. It is sixfold as Eye-Contact, Ear-Contact, Nose-Contact,
Tongue-Contact, Body-Contact, and Mind-Contact. By saying Contact arises
due to Six Sense Bases, it should not be taken that all six Contacts
arise from all six Bases, or that six Contacts arise from each Base.
Only Eye-Contact arises from the Eye Base. Only respective Contacts like
Ear-Contact etc. arise from each Base like Ear etc. In the Immaterial
World, only Mind-Contact arises. In the Fine-Material World, three
Contacts arise. In the Sense World, all six Contacts arise.</p>
<p>When the six Internal Bases exist, collisions with External Bases
occur at some time. If there are no Internal Bases, those collisions
never occur. Therefore, the existence of the six Bases is the cause for
the arising of Contact.</p>
<p><strong><em>Phassa paccayā vedanā</em></strong> <strong>Conditioned
by Contact, Feeling comes to be.</strong></p>
<p>Since Contact is a Universal Cetasika, it exists in all Cittas. All
of them are conditions for Feelings. However, in this talk on Dependent
Origination, only the Contact existing in the thirty-two Mundane
Resultant Cittas is taken. Although Feeling exists in every Citta, only
the thirty-two Mundane Resultant Feelings are taken here.</p>
<p>If there is Contact, a Feeling also arises. If there is no Contact, a
Feeling will never arise. For Feeling to arise, Contact must be present.
Therefore, it is said that conditioned by Contact, Feeling comes to
be.</p>
<p><strong><em>Vedanā paccayā taṇhā</em></strong> <strong>Conditioned by
Feeling, Craving comes to be.</strong></p>
<p>Here, the eighty-one Feelings applying in the eighty-one Mundane
Cittas are taken as the Feeling causing Craving. Although Craving
arising from the cause of Feeling is generally one, it is sixfold by way
of objects as Form Craving, Sound Craving, Smell Craving, Taste Craving,
Tangible Craving, and Dhamma Craving. Since each of those Cravings is
threefold as Sensual Craving, Craving for Existence, and Craving for
Non-Existence, there are eighteen Cravings. Since they are obtained in
both Internal and External continuities, there are thirty-six Cravings
by way of continuity. Since each of those Cravings is threefold by way
of the three times Past, Future, and Present, there are one hundred and
eight Cravings.</p>
<p>Since beings like pleasant feeling, it is apparent that craving
arises regarding it. Unpleasant feeling is something beings dislike. A
question arises here: how does unpleasant feeling, which is a disliked
thing, become a cause for craving? It is true that beings dislike
unpleasant feeling. A desire for happiness arises in the being oppressed
by unpleasant feeling. The cause for that was the unpleasant feeling
that arose in him. Therefore, know that unpleasant feeling is also a
cause for craving. Since equanimous feeling is peaceful, beings like it
too. Therefore, all three feelings are taken as causes for craving.</p>
<p><strong><em>Taṇhā paccayā upādānaṃ</em></strong> <strong>Conditioned
by Craving, Clinging comes to be.</strong></p>
<p>It was stated in the Seventh Chapter that there are four Clingings
(<em>Upādāna</em>). When taken by way of Dhamma, there are two
Clingings: Craving and View. The difference between Craving arising
conditioned by Feeling and Clinging Craving is as follows: Craving
conditioned by Feeling is weak. Clinging Craving conditioned by Craving
is strong. Craving conditioned by Feeling should be known like the
craving arising in a gem miner before finding a gem. Clinging Craving
should be known like the craving arising regarding a valuable gem that
has come to hand.</p>
<p>For both Buddhists and non-Buddhists, Craving arises conditioned by
Feeling. From Craving, Clinging to Sense Pleasures arises. Due to
Craving, Clinging to Doctrine of Self also arises in both Buddhists and
non-Buddhists. Clinging to Wrong Views and Clinging to Rites and
Ceremonies cannot arise in true Buddhists.</p>
<p>Clingings arise due to the development of Craving arising because of
Feeling.</p>
<p><strong><em>Upādāna paccayā bhavo</em></strong> <strong>Conditioned
by Clinging, Existence comes to be.</strong></p>
<p>There are two Existences (<em>Bhava</em>) arising from the condition
of Clinging: Kamma Existence and Rebirth Existence. The group of Mundane
Wholesome and Unwholesome Volitions is called ‘<strong>Kamma
Existence</strong>’. The twelve Unwholesome Cittas, seventeen Mundane
Wholesome Cittas, and fifty-two Cetasikas—this group of Dhammas itself
is also called ‘Kamma Existence’. The thirty-two Mundane Resultants, the
thirty-five Cetasikas applying in them, and the twenty Kamma-born
Rūpas—this group of Dhammas is called ‘<strong>Rebirth
Existence</strong>’.</p>
<p>Nine Rebirth Existences are also shown as: Sense Existence,
Fine-Material Existence, Immaterial Existence, Percipient Existence,
Non-Percipient Existence, Neither-Percipient-Nor-Non-Percipient
Existence, One-Constituent Existence, Four-Constituent Existence, and
Five-Constituent Existence. Sense Existence etc. are apparent. The
Asañña Existence having only one aggregate, the Materiality Aggregate,
is called One-Constituent Existence. The Immaterial Existence having
only four Name Aggregates is called Four-Constituent Existence. All
remaining existences having all five aggregates are called
Five-Constituent Existence.</p>
<p>When Clingings have arisen, because of them, the Five Aggregates
taken as “I” and “mine” start doing various things to maintain them, to
make them happy, and to obtain future Five Aggregates. Those things done
are the Kamma Existence arising from the condition of Clinging. Rebirth
Existence does not arise directly due to Clingings. It arises due to
Kamma Existence. The cause of Rebirth Existence is Kamma Existence. The
cause of Kamma Existence is Clinging. The arising of Rebirth Existence
conditioned by Clinging is stated by taking the cause producing Kamma
Existence as the cause of Rebirth Existence as well. In the world, the
cause of the cause is also sometimes spoken of as the cause. “Rice is
cooked by firewood” is such a place. Rice is cooked not by firewood but
by fire. Firewood is the cause of fire. However, firewood, the cause of
fire, is taken as the cause of rice and spoken of. Know that saying
Rebirth Existence arises conditioned by Clinging is also like that.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bhava paccayā jāti</em></strong> <strong>Conditioned by
Existence, Birth comes to be.</strong></p>
<p>Here, <strong>Birth (<em>Jāti</em>)</strong> refers to the Aggregates
first appearing in beings in respective existences. Of Kamma Existence
and Rebirth Existence, only Kamma Existence is a condition for Birth.
Therefore, although both Kamma Existence and Rebirth Existence are taken
by the word <em>Bhava</em> in “<em>Upādāna paccayā bhavo</em>,” in
“<em>Bhava paccayā jāti</em>,” only Kamma Existence should be taken by
the word <em>Bhava</em>. That Kamma Existence is a condition for Birth
can be understood from the differences in beings. Even twin children
born at once from the same mother and raised together differ from each
other in happiness and suffering etc. because of Kamma.</p>
<p>The Formations (<em>Saṅkhāra</em>) mentioned in “<em>Avijjā paccayā
saṅkhārā</em>” and this Kamma Existence are similar by way of Kamma.
Three Existences are connected to this teaching of Dependent
Origination. By the name <em>Saṅkhāra</em>, the past kamma that caused
the birth of the present existence is referred to. By the name <em>Kamma
Bhava</em>, the kamma done in the present existence is referred to.</p>
<p><strong><em>Jāti paccayā jarā maraṇaṃ soka parideva dukkha
domanassupāyāsā sambhavanti.</em></strong> <strong>Conditioned by Birth,
Decay and Death, Sorrow, Lamentation, Pain, Grief, and Despair come to
be.</strong></p>
<p>If there is Birth, Decay and Death will definitely occur. Sorrow,
Lamentation, Pain, Grief, and Despair also occur to many beings. Sorrow
etc. occur less for some beings and more for some beings. They do not
exist in Fine-Material and Immaterial worlds. Sorrow etc., which do not
happen to everyone with Birth, are included here and preached to show
the evil of the cycle of Saṃsāra.</p>
<p>Here, <strong>Decay (<em>Jarā</em>)</strong> is the state of
approaching the dissolution of Name-and-Matter. <strong>Death
(<em>Maraṇa</em>)</strong> is the dissolution, the destruction of
Name-and-Matter. <strong>Sorrow (<em>Soka</em>)</strong> is the
Unpleasant Feeling due to loss of relatives etc. <strong>Lamentation
(<em>Parideva</em>)</strong> is the undesirable sound uttered by those
sorrowing due to loss of relatives etc. <strong>Pain
(<em>Dukkha</em>)</strong> is Bodily Painful Feeling. <strong>Grief
(<em>Domanassa</em>)</strong> is Mental Painful Feeling. <strong>Despair
(<em>Upāyāsa</em>)</strong> is the great exhaustion arising in the mind
due to loss of relatives etc. It is the Hatred Cetasika arising in a
certain way.</p>

<li>Facts to be Known about Dependent Origination - Abhidhamma

</ol>
<h2 id="facts-to-be-known-about-dependent-origination">4. Facts to be
Known about Dependent Origination</h2>
<p>In this Dependent Origination, there are three Times, twelve Factors,
twenty Modes, three Connections, four Groups, three Rounds, and two
Roots. To have complete knowledge of Dependent Origination, these must
also be known.</p>
<p><strong>Three Times</strong></p>
<p>Of the factors of Dependent Origination, <strong>Ignorance and
Formations</strong> belong to the <strong>Past Time</strong>.
<strong>Birth and Decay-and-Death</strong> belong to the <strong>Future
Time</strong>. The eight factors: <strong>Consciousness,
Name-and-Matter, Six Sense Bases, Contact, Feeling, Craving, Clinging,
and Existence</strong> belong to the <strong>Present Time</strong>.
Speaking by way of existence, Ignorance and Formations belong to the
Past Existence. Birth and Decay-and-Death belong to the Future
Existence. The middle eight factors belong to the Present Existence.</p>
<p>Just as someone takes a little water from the great ocean in the hand
and shows by it that the water in the entire great ocean is salty, the
Tathāgata, by showing the present existence completely through
“<em>Avijjā paccayā saṅkhārā</em>” etc., showed the entire endless
Saṃsāra. When completing one existence and preaching, the cause and
effect of that existence must also be shown. The two factors Ignorance
and Formations are added to Dependent Origination to show the cause of
the arising of the present existence. Birth and Decay-and-Death are
added to show the future result of the present existence.</p>
<p>Here, the Tathāgata preached past causes to dispel the view that the
being arose spontaneously and the view that the being was created by
God. Future results were shown to dispel the view that there is no birth
after death. The cause-and-effect continuity was preached to dispel the
Self View.</p>
<p><strong>Twelve Factors</strong></p>
<p>Ignorance, Formations, Consciousness, Name-and-Matter, Six Sense
Bases, Contact, Feeling, Craving, Clinging, Existence, Birth, and
Decay-and-Death are the twelve factors of Dependent Origination. Since
Sorrow etc. five do not occur for everyone, they are not taken as
factors of Dependent Origination.</p>
<p><strong>Four Groups (<em>Saṅkhepa</em>)</strong></p>
<p>These twelve factors of Dependent Origination are divided into four
parts. Those parts are called <em>Saṅkhepa</em>.</p>
<p>The two factors Ignorance and Formations are one Group. The five
factors Consciousness, Name-and-Matter, Six Sense Bases, Contact, and
Feeling are one Group. The three factors Craving, Clinging, and
Existence are one Group. The two factors Birth and Decay-and-Death are
one Group.</p>
<p><strong>Three Connections (<em>Sandhi</em>)</strong></p>
<p>There is one Connection between Formations belonging to the past
existence and Consciousness belonging to the present existence. There is
one Connection between Feeling and Craving of the present existence.
There is one Connection between Existence and Birth.</p>
<p>Thus there are three Connections here. When there are three
Connections, there are four Parts.</p>
<p><strong>Twenty Modes (<em>Ākāra</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Of the factors of Dependent Origination, Ignorance and Formations are
causes belonging to the past existence. Where Ignorance and Formations
exist, the three factors Craving, Clinging, and Existence also exist.
Since those three are also implied when Ignorance and Formations are
mentioned, they are not explicitly preached in the Dependent Origination
Pali. However, all five: <strong>Ignorance, Formations, Craving,
Clinging, and Existence</strong> should be taken as causes belonging to
the past existence. The five factors: Consciousness, Name-and-Matter,
Six Sense Bases, Contact, and Feeling arising in the present existence
are the results of causes belonging to the past existence. The three:
Craving, Clinging, and Existence appearing in the Dependent Origination
Pali are the causes of the present existence producing the future
existence. If there are Craving, Clinging, and Existence, Ignorance and
Formations also exist. Therefore, all five: Craving, Clinging,
Existence, Ignorance, and Formations are taken as present causes. The
Dependent Origination Pali states that Decay-and-Death arise in the
future due to those five causes. Birth and Decay-and-Death refer to the
five factors: <strong>Consciousness, Name-and-Matter, Six Sense Bases,
Contact, and Feeling</strong>.</p>
<p>Ignorance, Formations, Craving, Clinging, and Existence—these five
are Past Causes. Consciousness, Name-and-Matter, Six Sense Bases,
Contact, and Feeling—these five are Present Results. Craving, Clinging,
Existence, Ignorance, and Formations—these five are Present Causes.
Consciousness, Name-and-Matter, Six Sense Bases, Contact, and
Feeling—these five are Future Results.</p>
<p>These twenty Dhammas are called the Twenty Modes.</p>
<p>Because of the five causes of the past existence, the five results of
the present existence arise. Because of the five causes arising again in
the present existence, the five results belonging to the future
existence arise. In the future existence too, by Craving, Clinging etc.
arising again, an existence is produced again by them. Thus Saṃsāra
exists uninterruptedly. Since the result arises from the cause, and
again the cause, and from it the result arises again, this
cause-and-effect continuity is like a wheel. Therefore, this
cause-and-effect continuity is called the <strong>Wheel of
Saṃsāra</strong> (<em>Saṃsāra Cakka</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Three Rounds (<em>Vaṭṭa</em>)</strong></p>
<p>There are three Rounds here. Round means the thing that turns again
and again. Here, the three factors: <strong>Ignorance, Craving, and
Clinging</strong> are the <strong>Round of Defilements</strong>
(<em>Kilesa Vaṭṭa</em>). <strong>Kamma Existence and Formations</strong>
are the <strong>Round of Kamma</strong> (<em>Kamma Vaṭṭa</em>).
<strong>Rebirth Existence, Consciousness, Name-and-Matter, Six Sense
Bases, Contact, Feeling, Birth, and Decay-and-Death</strong>—these are
the <strong>Round of Results</strong> (<em>Vipāka Vaṭṭa</em>). Due to
Defilements, Kamma arises. Due to Kamma, Result arises. Due to Result,
Defilements arise again. Thus, by the turning of these three:
Defilements, Kamma, and Result, Saṃsāra exists uninterruptedly.</p>
<p><strong>Two Roots (<em>Mūla</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Ignorance is one root Dhamma of this Wheel of Saṃsāra. Craving is one
root Dhamma. Although this cause-and-effect continuity exists like a
wheel, if Ignorance and Craving are destroyed, the Wheel of Saṃsāra is
cut off. The Wheel of Saṃsāra cannot be escaped by any other method than
destroying those two. Therefore, Ignorance and Craving are the root
Dhammas, the main Dhammas of this wheel. The wise destroy Ignorance and
Craving through practice, escape from the Wheel of Saṃsāra, and arrive
at Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Because Dependent Origination is preached starting with Ignorance, it
should not be taken that Ignorance is the beginning of Saṃsāra. This is
not a teaching showing the root or beginning of the world. This teaching
shows the method in which Saṃsāra exists. This wheel exists like this
into the future. It existed so in the past. There is no time in the past
when this Wheel of Saṃsāra did not exist. Therefore, know that there is
no root which is a beginning here.</p>

<li>The Method of Conditional Relations (Paṭṭhāna) - Abhidhamma
Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-method-of-conditional-relations-paṭṭhāna">5. The Method of
Conditional Relations (Paṭṭhāna)</h2>
<p>The thing that helps another to arise is called
“<strong>Condition</strong>” (<em>Paccaya</em>). It is not wrong to say
the thing that produces another thing is a “Condition.” The thing arisen
with the help of another is called “<strong>Conditioned State</strong>”
(<em>Paccayuppanna</em>). Saying the thing produced by another is a
“Conditioned State” is also suitable. Fire arises with the help of the
substance held at the tip of the matchstick and the substance coated on
the matchbox. The two types of substances coated on the matchstick and
the matchbox which helped the fire to arise, or produced the fire, are
Conditions. The fire is the Conditioned State. Thus, Condition and
Conditioned State should be identified separately.</p>
<p>The substance coated on the matchstick helps the arising of fire in
one way. The substance coated on the matchbox helps in another way. If
the chemical on the matchstick and the chemical on the matchbox helped
the arising of fire in the same way, fire could arise from one of them
alone. It does not happen so because two helps having separate modes
from those two are needed for the fire to arise. Just as there are two
modes of being a condition in the matchbox and the matchstick, know that
there are various modes of helping other things in manifold objects
existing in the world. Those special modes of helping are called
‘<strong>Conditioning Force</strong>’ (<em>Paccaya Satti</em>).</p>
<p>The Ultimate Realities: Citta, Cetasika, and Rūpa arise from
conditions. Nibbāna and Concepts do not arise from conditions. There are
Conditioning Forces in all things arising from conditions and not
arising from conditions. There is absolutely no Dhamma that does not
have some Conditioning Force. There is not just one Conditioning Force
in one Dhamma. Some Dhammas have many Conditioning Forces. Some Dhamma
has few Conditioning Forces.</p>
<p>In the entire group of Dhammas which are past, future, present, and
freed from the three times, existing as Ultimate Realities and Concepts,
there are twenty-four Conditioning Forces. According to those
Conditioning Forces, the aforementioned group of Dhammas is divided into
twenty-four parts by the name Condition (<em>Paccaya</em>) in the
Paṭṭhāna Mahā Pakaraṇa. Those twenty-four parts are called “<strong>The
Twenty-Four Conditions</strong>.” The text showing the twenty-four
conditions in the Paṭṭhāna Pali is as follows:</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Lesson 6</strong></p>
<p><strong>(1) Root Condition (<em>Hetu Paccaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The Dhamma that helps by way of Root is Root Condition. Here, the
state of Root refers to the state of being a root (<em>mūla</em>). Just
as roots penetrate the earth and help the tree to stand without falling,
the Dhamma that penetrates the object itself and helps the Dhammas
arising together with itself to stand unshaken in the object is the Root
Condition. The six Dhammas: Greed, Hatred, Delusion, Non-Greed,
Non-Hatred, and Non-Delusion are the Root Conditions. The seventy-one
Rooted Cittas, the fifty-two Cetasikas excluding Delusion applying in
the Delusion Root, the Rooted Mind-born Rūpas, and the Kamma-born Rūpas
arising with the Rooted Rebirth-Linking Consciousness are the
Conditioned States (<em>Paccayuppanna</em>) of the Root Condition.</p>
<p>The count of Cetasikas does not decrease by excluding Delusion in the
Delusion-Rooted Citta because Delusion applying in Greed-Rooted and
Hatred-Rooted Cittas is taken. Delusion in the Delusion-Rooted Citta is
a condition by way of Root to the Delusion-Rooted Citta and to Cetasikas
other than Delusion applying with it. Since there is no other Root
Dhamma there to be a condition for Delusion by way of Root, the Delusion
of the Delusion Root is not Root Conditioned. In Cittas with two or
three roots, Root Dhammas are Conditioned States. Because one of the
Root Dhammas arising together is a condition for the other by way of
Root.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Object Condition (<em>Ārammaṇa Paccaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Dhammas helpful by way of Object are Object Condition. Citta and
Cetasikas cannot arise without taking an object. Therefore, every object
is a help for the arising of Citta and Cetasikas.</p>
<p>The eighty-nine Cittas, fifty-two Cetasikas, twenty-eight Rūpas,
Nibbāna, and Concepts—all are Object Conditions. There is nothing that
is not an Object Condition.</p>
<p>The eighty-nine Cittas and fifty-two Cetasikas are Object Conditioned
States.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Predominance Condition (<em>Adhipati
Paccaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The Dhamma helpful by way of Predominance is Predominance Condition.
Predominance is the nature of making others conform to oneself. Some
Dhammas have a nature of making other Dhammas conform to themselves. The
name Predominant is used for those Dhammas here. Predominance Condition
is twofold as “<strong>Object Predominance</strong>”
(<em>Ārammaṇādhipati</em>) and “<strong>Conascence
Predominance</strong>” (<em>Sahajātādhipati</em>). Certain objects have
a nature of attracting the mind. Because of that, many Cittas arise
attracted and inclined towards that object. That nature of attracting
the mind is the Predominant nature in the object.</p>
<p><strong>Object Predominance Condition</strong></p>
<p>The eighteen Concretely Produced Rūpas that are desirable and to be
respected, the eighty-four Cittas excluding the two Hatred-Rooted, two
Delusion-Rooted, and Pain-Accompanied Body Consciousness, the
forty-seven Cetasikas excluding Hatred, Envy, Avarice, Worry, and Doubt,
and Nibbāna—these Dhammas are Object Predominance Condition Dhammas.</p>
<p>The twenty-eight Cittas: eight Greed-Rooted Cittas, eight Great
Wholesome Cittas, four Great Functional Knowledge-Associated Cittas, and
eight Supramundane Cittas which take those Dhammas as object with
respect, and the forty-five Cetasikas excluding Hatred, Envy, Avarice,
Worry, Doubt, Compassion, and Appreciative Joy—these are Object
Predominance Conditioned States.</p>
<p><strong>Conascence Predominance Condition</strong></p>
<p>The four Predominant Dhammas: Desire, Consciousness, Energy, and
Investigation are called Conascence Predominance because they are
conditions by way of Predominance for those associated with themselves.
Only one of these four becomes Predominant at one time. Two or three do
not become Predominant at once.</p>
<p>Two-Rooted and Three-Rooted Javana Cittas, Desire, Energy, and
Investigation become Predominance Conditions when they themselves are
Predominant.</p>
<p>Excluding the Dhamma that is Predominant at that respective occasion,
the fifty-two Dominant Javanas (<em>Sādhipati Javana</em>), Cetasikas
other than Doubt, and Rūpas arising from those Cittas—these are
Conascence Predominance Conditioned States.</p>
<p><strong>4, 5 Proximity (<em>Anantara</em>) and Contiguity
(<em>Samanantara</em>) Conditions</strong></p>
<p>In the stream of consciousness existing in beings, subsequent Cittas
arise because of preceding Cittas. If there were no preceding Cittas,
subsequent Cittas would also not arise. Every Citta has a nature of
helping another Citta to arise without a gap, so that the place does not
become empty as soon as it ceases. Because of that, as soon as one Citta
ceases, another Citta arises. The power in the ceasing preceding Cittas
to produce another Citta right next to them is the <strong>Proximity
Power</strong>. The Dhamma helpful by Proximity Power is the
<strong>Proximity Condition</strong>. There is also a nature in ceasing
Cittas helpful for the arising of the Citta arising subsequent to itself
appropriately to the place. That is called <strong>Contiguity
Power</strong>. The Dhamma helpful by Contiguity Power is the
<strong>Contiguity Condition</strong>. Both Proximity and Contiguity
powers exist in the same Citta. Therefore, except for the Arahant Death
Consciousness, every ceasing Citta and every Cetasika is both Proximity
Condition and Contiguity Condition. All Cittas and Cetasikas arising
subsequent to the Arahant Death Consciousness are both Proximity
Conditioned and Contiguity Conditioned.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 7</strong></p>
<p><strong>(6) Conascence Condition (<em>Sahajāta
Paccaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The Dhamma that helps other Dhammas to arise together with itself
when it arises is Conascence Condition.</p>
<p>The eighty-nine Cittas and fifty-two Cetasikas which are conditions
for each other and for Mind-born Rūpas and Rebirth-Linking Kamma-born
Rūpas arising with them; the four Great Essentials which are conditions
for each other and for Derived Rūpas; the Heart-Base which is a
condition for Five-Constituent Rebirth-Linking Name Aggregates—these are
Conascence Condition Dhammas.</p>
<p>The Name Aggregates consisting of eighty-nine Cittas and fifty-two
Cetasikas receiving condition from each other; the Great Essentials with
Derived Rūpas receiving help from each other; the Five-Constituent
Rebirth-Linking Name Aggregates receiving condition from the Heart-Base;
and the Heart-Base receiving condition from the Five-Constituent
Rebirth-Linking Name Aggregates—these are the Conditioned States of
Conascence Condition.</p>
<p><strong>(7) Mutuality Condition (<em>Aññamañña
Paccaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The Dhamma that helps a certain Dhamma while also receiving help from
that Dhamma is Mutuality Condition. The eighty-nine Cittas and fifty-two
Cetasikas helpful to each other; the four Great Essentials helpful to
each other; the Five-Constituent Rebirth-Linking Name Aggregates and
Heart-Base helpful to each other—these are Mutuality Condition Dhammas.
Those same Dhammas receiving help mutually are Mutuality Conditioned
States.</p>
<p><strong>(8) Support Condition (<em>Nissaya Paccaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The Dhamma helpful to another Dhamma to stand, just as paper etc. is
helpful for paintings etc., is Support Condition. Support Condition is
twofold as Conascence Support (<em>Sahajāta Nissaya</em>) and
Prenascence Support (<em>Purejāta Nissaya</em>). Dhammas that become a
support while arising together with the Conditioned State are Conascence
Support. Dhammas that become a support for subsequently arising Dhammas
after arising first are Prenascence Support.</p>
<p>Know the Condition and Conditioned States of Conascence Support
Condition as in Conascence Condition.</p>
<p>Prenascence Support is also twofold as Base Prenascence Support
(<em>Vatthu Purejāta Nissaya</em>) and Base-Object Prenascence Support
(<em>Vatthārammaṇa Purejāta Nissaya</em>). In the course of existence,
the six bases: Eye etc. become Base Prenascence Support Condition.
Cittas and Cetasikas except Immaterial Resultants are Conditioned
States. (Base-Object Prenascence Condition is not shown as it is
difficult to understand.)</p>
<p><strong>(9) Decisive Support Condition (<em>Upanissaya
Paccaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The Dhamma that is very helpful for the arising of a certain Dhamma
is Decisive Support Condition. Decisive Support Condition is of three
kinds: Object Decisive Support (<em>Ārammaṇopanissaya</em>), Proximity
Decisive Support (<em>Anantaropanissaya</em>), and Natural Decisive
Support (<em>Pakatupanissaya</em>).</p>
<p>The object respected as a good thing by the world is Object Decisive
Support Condition. Condition and Conditioned States there are as in
Object Predominance.</p>
<p>The Citta that arose and ceased immediately close before a Citta
arises is Proximity Decisive Support Condition. Although there are
conditions like Object etc., since a Citta cannot arise without it, the
Citta ceased nearby is a powerful help to the subsequently arising
Citta. Conditions and Conditioned States in Proximity Decisive Support
are as in Proximity Condition.</p>
<p>Dhammas such as Lust (<em>Rāga</em>) etc., Faith (<em>Saddhā</em>)
etc., and pleasure, pain etc. arising in one continuity become a special
cause for the arising of many Cittas and Cetasikas in that continuity at
a later time. Those Dhammas like Lust are Natural Decisive Support
Condition.</p>
<p>The eighty-nine Cittas, fifty-two Cetasikas, twenty-eight Rūpas, and
certain Concepts—these are Natural Decisive Support Condition Dhammas.
The eighty-nine Cittas and fifty-two Cetasikas arising because of them
are Conditioned States.</p>
<p><strong>(10) Prenascence Condition (<em>Purejāta
Paccaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The Dhamma that becomes a condition for subsequently arising Dhammas
after arising first is Prenascence Condition. Prenascence Condition is
of three kinds: Base Prenascence Condition (<em>Vatthu Purejāta
Paccaya</em>), Base-Object Prenascence Condition (<em>Vatthārammaṇa
Purejāta Paccaya</em>), and Object Prenascence Condition (<em>Ārammaṇa
Purejāta Paccaya</em>). Of them, Base Prenascence Condition is like Base
Prenascence Support Condition. Base-Object Prenascence Condition is like
Base-Object Prenascence Support Condition. The eighteen Concretely
Produced Rūpas which are conditions for subsequently arising Citta and
Cetasikas after arising first are Object Prenascence Condition. The
fifty-four Sense-Sphere Cittas arising in the Five-Constituent Plane,
the two Direct Knowledge Cittas, and the fifty Cetasikas excluding
Illimitables are Conditioned States.</p>
<p><strong>(11) Postnascence Condition (<em>Pacchājāta
Paccaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Subsequently arising Citta and Cetasikas that give support to Rūpa
Dhammas arisen earlier and existing are Postnascence Condition.</p>
<p>The eighty-five subsequently arising Cittas such as the first
Bhavanga etc. arising in the Five-Constituent Plane, other than
Immaterial Resultants, and the fifty-two Cetasikas are Postnascence
Condition Dhammas. Rūpas arising with Rebirth-Linking etc. first Cittas
and reached the static stage are Conditioned States. This condition is a
condition that only gives support to the Conditioned State, not one that
produces it.</p>
<p><strong>(12) Repetition Condition (<em>Āsevana
Paccaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Just as paint applied first helps the paint applied later to become
colorful by taking its nature, the preceding Cittas that help subsequent
Citta and Cetasikas to become powerful by taking their nature are
Repetition Condition. Repetition exists in Javana Cittas.</p>
<p>Excluding the last Javana and Fruit Javanas, the forty-seven
preceding Mundane Javanas and fifty-two Cetasikas are Repetition
Condition Dhammas. Excluding the first Javana and Fruit Javanas, the
subsequent Javana Cittas and Cetasikas are Conditioned States.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 8</strong></p>
<p><strong>(13) Kamma Condition (<em>Kamma Paccaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The Volition Cetasika which is the effort to perform respective
actions is called Kamma Condition. There are two Kamma Conditions:
Conascent Kamma Condition (<em>Sahajāta Kamma Paccaya</em>) and
Asynchronous Kamma Condition (<em>Nānākkhaṇika Kamma Paccaya</em>).
Volition is a Universal Cetasika. It arises generating Citta, other
Cetasikas, and a part of Rūpa. Since the Volition arising thus is a
condition for Dhammas arising with it, it is called Conascent Kamma
Condition. Volitions in the eighty-nine Cittas are all Conascent Kamma
Condition. The eighty-nine Cittas, the fifty-one Cetasikas excluding
Volition, Mind-born Rūpas, and Rebirth-Linking Kamma-born Rūpas are the
Conditioned States of Conascent Kamma Condition.</p>
<p>The group of Wholesome and Unwholesome Volitions producing its result
at a later time, stated another way, the thirty-three Past Wholesome and
Unwholesome Volitions, are Asynchronous Kamma Condition. Thirty-six
Resultant Cittas, thirty-eight Cetasikas, and eighteen Kamma-born Rūpas
are Conditioned States of Asynchronous Kamma Condition. Since the moment
the Condition arises and the moment the Conditioned State arises are
different, this condition is called Asynchronous (<em>Nānākkhaṇika</em>)
Kamma Condition.</p>
<p><strong>(14) Result Condition (<em>Vipāka Paccaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The Dhamma that helps the Dhammas arising with it to arise in an
effortless, peaceful state, while being in an effortless, peaceful state
itself, is Result Condition. The thirty-six Resultant Cittas and
thirty-eight Cetasikas which are conditions for each other and for
Mind-born Rūpas and Rebirth-Linking Kamma-born Rūpas are Result
Condition Dhammas.</p>
<p>The thirty-six Resultant Cittas, thirty-eight Cetasikas receiving
condition from each other, Mind-born Rūpas other than Intimation Rūpas
produced by Resultant Cittas, and Rebirth-Linking Kamma-born Rūpas are
Conditioned States of Result Condition.</p>
<p><strong>(15) Nutriment Condition (<em>Āhāra
Paccaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Name-and-Matter having the nature of producing certain
Name-and-Matter, and supporting the existence for a long time of
Name-and-Matter lineages arising from Kamma etc. conditions, are
identified by the name Nutriment Condition. The main thing done by
Nutriment Condition is supporting Name-and-Matter lineages. Stated
another way, supporting the being to live for a long time.</p>
<p>There are two Nutriment Conditions: Name Nutriment Condition
(<em>Nāmāhāra Paccaya</em>) and Material Nutriment Condition
(<em>Rūpāhāra Paccaya</em>). The three Dhammas: Contact, Volition, and
Consciousness are Name Nutriment Condition. The eighty-nine Cittas,
fifty-two Cetasikas, Mind-born Rūpas, and Rebirth-Linking Kamma-born
Rūpas are the Conditioned States of Name Nutriment Condition.</p>
<p>The Nutritive Essence (<em>Ojā Rūpa</em>) in food etc. called Edible
Food is Material Nutriment Condition. Rūpas arising from Nutriment are
its Conditioned States.</p>
<p><strong>(16) Faculty Condition (<em>Indriya
Paccaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The Dhamma helpful by way of Faculty, by way of Lordship, is Faculty
Condition. There are three Faculty Conditions: Conascent Faculty
Condition (<em>Sahajātindriya Paccaya</em>), Prenascent Faculty
Condition (<em>Purejātindriya Paccaya</em>), and Material Life Faculty
Condition (<em>Rūpajīvitindriya Paccaya</em>).</p>
<p>The Name Faculties: Consciousness, Feeling, Faith, Energy,
Mindfulness, One-pointedness, and Wisdom are Conascent Faculty Condition
Dhammas. The eighty-nine Cittas, fifty-two Cetasikas, Mind-born Rūpas,
and Rebirth-Linking Kamma-born Rūpas are its Conditioned States.</p>
<p>The five Sensitive Rūpas: Eye, Ear, Nose, Tongue, Body are Prenascent
Faculty Condition. The Two Sets of Fivefold Sense Consciousness
(<em>Dvipañca Viññāṇa</em>) and the seven Universal Cetasikas are its
Conditioned States.</p>
<p>The Life Faculty Rūpa is Material Life Faculty Condition. Rūpas other
than Life Faculty Rūpa in Kamma-born Material Groups are its Conditioned
States.</p>
<p><strong>(17) Jhāna Condition (<em>Jhāna Paccaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Dhammas like Initial Application (<em>Vitakka</em>) having special
effort in taking the object are Jhāna. Because of that special effort of
Vitakka etc. in taking the object, other Dhammas arise in accordance
with it. Since they are causes for the arising of such arising Dhammas,
Vitakka etc. are called Jhāna Condition.</p>
<p>The five Jhāna Factor Dhammas: Vitakka, Vicāra, Vedanā, Pīti,
Ekaggatā in the seventy-nine Cittas other than Dvipañca Viññāṇa are
Jhāna Condition. The seventy-nine Cittas other than Dvipañca Viññāṇa,
fifty-two Cetasikas, and Mind-born and Rebirth-Linking Kamma-born Rūpas
are Conditioned States of Jhāna Condition.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 9</strong></p>
<p><strong>(18) Path Condition (<em>Magga Paccaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Dhammas that are conditions for conascent Name-and-Matter by special
power of sending to Good Destinations, Bad Destinations, and Nibbāna are
Path Condition.</p>
<p>The nine Path Factor Dhammas: Wisdom, Initial Application, Right
Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Energy, Mindfulness,
One-pointedness, and Wrong View applying in Rooted Cittas are Path
Condition. Seventy-one Rooted Cittas, fifty-two Cetasikas, Rooted
Mind-born Rūpas, and Rooted Rebirth-Linking Kamma-born Rūpas are
Conditioned States of Path Condition.</p>
<p><strong>(19) Association Condition (<em>Sampayutta
Paccaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The Dhamma helpful by way of reaching mixture so that there is no gap
is Association Condition. The Name Dhammas: eighty-nine Cittas and
fifty-two Cetasikas, which are conditions for each other, are
Association Condition Dhammas. Citta and Cetasika Dhammas receiving
condition from each other are Conditioned States there.</p>
<p><strong>(20) Dissociation Condition (<em>Vippayutta
Paccaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The Dhamma that is a condition by way of not mixing with each other
although existing touching together is Dissociation Condition. There are
three Dissociation Conditions: Conascent Dissociation, Prenascent
Dissociation, and Postnascent Dissociation.</p>
<p>The seventy-five Cittas other than Immaterial Resultants, Dvipañca
Viññāṇa, and Arahant Death arising in the Five-Constituent Plane, the
fifty-two Cetasikas, the Heart-Base which is a condition for the
Five-Constituent Rebirth-Linking Name Aggregate, and the
Five-Constituent Rebirth-Linking Name Aggregates which are conditions
for the Heart-Base—these are Conascent Dissociation Condition
Dhammas.</p>
<p>Mind-born Rūpas, Rebirth-Linking Kamma-born Rūpas, Five-Constituent
Rebirth-Linking Name Aggregates receiving condition from the Heart-Base,
and the Heart-Base receiving condition from Five-Constituent
Rebirth-Linking Name Aggregates—these are Conditioned States of
Conascent Dissociation Condition.</p>
<p>Prenascent Dissociation should be known like Prenascence Condition,
and Postnascent Dissociation like Postnascence Condition.</p>
<p><strong>(21) Presence Condition (<em>Atthi Paccaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The very existence of some Dhamma is the cause for the arising of
another Dhamma. The Dhamma helpful by way of existence is Presence
Condition. Presence Condition is sevenfold as Conascent Presence
Condition, Base Prenascent Presence Condition, Base-Object Prenascent
Presence Condition, Object Prenascent Presence Condition, Postnascent
Presence Condition, Nutriment Presence Condition, and Faculty Presence
Condition. Their Condition and Conditioned States should be known just
as in those respective conditions.</p>
<p><strong>(22) Absence Condition (<em>Natthi Paccaya</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Where one thing exists, there is no room for another. Therefore, the
absence of something is a help for the arising of another there. The
Dhamma helpful for the arising of another by going away by way of
cessation is Absence Condition. Its Condition and Conditioned States
should be known as in Proximity (<em>Anantara</em>) Condition.</p>
<p><strong>(23, 24) Disappearance (<em>Vigata</em>) and
Non-Disappearance (<em>Avigata</em>) Conditions</strong></p>
<p>The Dhamma helpful for the appearing of another in its place by its
disappearance is Disappearance Condition. The Dhamma helpful for the
arising of another by non-disappearance, i.e., by existing state, is
Non-Disappearance Condition. By way of Dhamma and Force, there is no
difference between Presence and Non-Disappearance. Similarly, there is
no difference between Absence and Disappearance. It is the custom of the
Tathāgata to preach the same matter preached once in other words in some
places. This is also such a place. It is done according to persons who
understand the matter when said in those respective words.</p>
<p><strong>Manifold Condition State of Each Dhamma</strong></p>
<p>If the Condition and Conditioned States shown so far are examined, it
will be seen that a single Dhamma belongs to many Conditions, and
likewise belongs to Conditioned States of many Conditions. From that, it
should be understood that one Ultimate Dhamma has multiple Conditioning
Forces, a single Dhamma is conditioned by multiple Conditioning Forces,
and each Dhamma arises from many Conditions.</p>
<p>Know that the Greed Cetasika, which is a condition for associated
Dhammas by Root Force, while being a condition for associated Dhammas by
Root Force, is also a condition by Conascence, Mutuality, Conascence
Support, Association, Presence, and Non-Disappearance forces.</p>
<p>That Greed Cetasika is also Root Conditioned due to the Delusion Root
applying with it. It is also a Conditioned State of Object,
Predominance, Proximity, Contiguity, Conascence, Mutuality, Support,
Decisive Support, Repetition, Kamma, Nutriment, Faculty, Jhāna, Path,
Association, Presence, and Non-Disappearance conditions.</p>
<p>Thus, the state of being a Condition and the state of being
Conditioned of respective Dhammas should be found.</p>

<li>Summary of How Conditions Function - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="summary-of-how-conditions-function">6. Summary of How Conditions
Function</h2>
<p><strong>Lesson 10</strong></p>
<p>Name is a condition for Name in six ways. Name is a condition for
Name-and-Matter in five ways. Name is a condition for Matter in one way.
Matter is a condition for Name in one way. Concept-Name-Matter are
conditions for Name in two ways. Name-and-Matter are conditions for
Name-and-Matter in nine ways. Thus conditioning is sixfold.</p>
<p><strong>Six ways Name is a condition for Name</strong></p>
<p>Citta and Cetasikas ceasing immediately close are conditions for
Citta and Cetasikas arising immediately close to them by Proximity,
Contiguity, Absence, and Disappearance forces. First Javanas in
respective processes are conditions for subsequent Javanas by Repetition
force. Citta and Cetasika Dhammas arising together are conditions for
each other by Association force. Thus Name is a condition for Name in
six ways.</p>
<p><strong>Five ways Name is a condition for
Name-and-Matter</strong></p>
<p>Roots, Jhāna Factors, Path Factors—these are conditions for Conascent
Name-and-Matter by Root, Jhāna, Path forces. Conascent Volition is a
condition for Conascent Name-and-Matter, and Asynchronous Volition is a
condition for Name-and-Matter produced by Kamma. Resultant Citta and
Cetasikas are conditions for each other and Conascent Rūpas by Result
force. Thus Name is a condition for Name-and-Matter in five ways.</p>
<p><strong>One way Name is a condition for Matter</strong></p>
<p>Subsequently arising Citta and Cetasikas are conditions for this
Material Body arisen earlier by Postnascence force. Thus Name is a
condition for Matter in one way.</p>
<p><strong>One way Matter is a condition for Name</strong></p>
<p>In the course of existence, the six Base Rūpas: Eye etc. are
conditions for the seven Consciousness Elements, and the five objects:
Form etc. are conditions for Five-door Process Cittas by Prenascence
force. Thus Matter is a condition for Name in one way.</p>
<p><strong>Two ways Concept - Name - Matter are conditions for
Name</strong></p>
<p>Concept, Name, and Matter—all three are conditions for Name by Object
force and Decisive Support force. Thus Concept, Name, and Matter are
conditions for Name in two ways.</p>
<p><strong>Name - Matter being conditions for Name - Matter</strong></p>
<p>Name - Matter are conditions for Name - Matter appropriately by nine
Conditioning Forces: Predominance, Conascence, Mutuality, Support,
Nutriment, Faculty, Dissociation, Presence, and Non-Disappearance.</p>
<p>The entire group of Dhammas, threefold as Concept, Name, Matter,
belonging to the three times: Past, Future, Present, and not belonging
to the three times, Internal and External, belong to the twenty-four
Conditions appropriately. There is no Dhamma that is not some Condition.
From this group of Dhammas, except Nibbāna and Concepts, the remaining
Dhammas are also Conditioned States of respective Conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Name (<em>Nāma</em>) and Matter (<em>Rūpa</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The two words Name and Matter are two words frequently used in this
Dhamma. The eighty-nine Cittas, fifty-two Cetasikas, and Nibbāna—these
Dhammas are identified by the name <strong>Name</strong>
(<em>Nāma</em>). Those Dhammas have no shapes/forms. They are known by
hearing names like “Citta,” “Phassa,” “Vedanā,” etc. That is why the
name Name is given to them. The twenty-eight Rūpas called Aggregate of
Materiality are <strong>Matter</strong> (<em>Rūpa</em>). There are other
meanings for the words Name and Matter. What is given is the meaning
needed here. Name is also called Immaterial (<em>Arūpa</em>). The first
of the Five Aggregates is Aggregate of Materiality. The four aggregates:
Feeling, Perception, Formations, Consciousness are called Name
Aggregates.</p>

<li>Concepts (Paññatti) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="concepts-paññatti">7. Concepts (Paññatti)</h2>
<p><strong>Lesson 11</strong></p>
<p>Ultimate Reality (<em>Paramattha</em>) is not very apparent to the
public. What appears to them largely as things existing in the world are
Concepts (<em>Paññatti</em>). Therefore, the person learning Abhidhamma
must also gain an understanding of Concepts. Gaining an understanding of
Concepts is helpful to identify Ultimate Reality clearly, separating it
from Concepts. Therefore, a fair description of Concepts is also given
here.</p>
<p>Things that come to mind as truly existing, but are felt to be
non-existent when examined well, things that do not exist in truth, are
called Concepts. To know whether something felt as existing truly exists
or not, one must divide that thing and look. If the thing seen as
existing at first disappears when divided, it is not an Ultimate Reality
or something existing in truth. A cloth is considered as existing. If it
is divided, a heap of threads will be found. It is a heap of threads,
not a cloth. The cloth seen as existing earlier is not in that heap of
threads. When the threads are separated, the cloth disappears because
there is no cloth apart from threads. Everything that disappears when
divided like the cloth are Concepts.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of Concepts: Meaning Concept (<em>Attha
Paññatti</em>) and Name Concept (<em>Nāma Paññatti</em>). Meaning
Concept is things that do not exist as Ultimate Realities, which come to
mind according to spoken words. When the word “Table” is heard,
something is felt in the mind of the hearer because of that word. It is
called the meaning of the word. It is the Meaning Concept. It should not
be taken that the Meaning Concept felt according to words is felt only
according to words and not by other methods. Meaning Concept is also
felt by seeing with the eye etc. Since they are mostly felt according to
words, the name Meaning Concept is given to them.</p>
<p>There are many Meaning Concepts such as Shape Concept (<em>Saṇṭhāna
Paññatti</em>), Collective Concept (<em>Samūha Paññatti</em>), Being
Concept (<em>Satta Paññatti</em>), Direction Concept (<em>Disā
Paññatti</em>), Time Concept (<em>Kāla Paññatti</em>), etc.</p>
<p>Earth, mountain, tree, creeper, flower, leaf, fruit etc. felt by the
mind according to the shape of Great Essentials such as width, height,
shortness, roundness, squareness etc. are <strong>Shape
Concepts</strong>.</p>
<p>Table, chair, bed, mat, pillow, vehicle etc. felt by the mind as
existing due to various materials being collected and connected in
respective ways are <strong>Collective Concepts</strong>.</p>
<p>Deva, human, woman, man, elephant, horse, bull etc. felt by the mind
as if existing taking the Five Aggregates themselves as the sign are
<strong>Being Concepts</strong>.</p>
<p>East, West, North, South etc. felt due to the revolution of moon and
sun are <strong>Direction Concepts</strong>.</p>
<p>Morning, evening, day, night, year, month, date etc. felt due to the
revolution of moon and sun are <strong>Time Concepts</strong>.</p>
<p>Names like cloth, table, chair, tree, stone etc. which bring up a
certain meaning to the mind of the hearer are <strong>Name
Concepts</strong>. <strong>The difference between Sound and Name should
be known.</strong> Sound is an Ultimate Reality Dhamma. Name is a
Concept. Therefore, know that Sound is not Name. Just as a thing called
cloth, which does not exist in truth, is felt by the mind of the viewer
due to the heap of threads, manifold Name Concepts are felt by the mind
of the hearer due to the group of sounds. In “Table” (<em>Mē-sa-ya</em>
in Sinhala), there are three sounds: “Mē-sa-ya”. One or all of those
sounds is not the Name. When the sounds “Mē-sa-ya” are heard in order,
the Name Concept “Table” is a thing felt by the hearer’s mind due to
those three sounds. Because of that Name, the Meaning Concept called
Table rises to his mind. The Name Concept “Table” is one thing. It is a
thing felt by the mind due to the three sounds Mē-sa-ya. Considering the
stated facts with wisdom, understand the difference between Sound and
Name Concept. This is a place where some might get confused.</p>
<p>Name Concept is sixfold: Concept of the Real (<em>Vijjamāna
Paññatti</em>), Concept of the Unreal (<em>Avijjamāna Paññatti</em>),
Concept of the Unreal by means of the Real (<em>Vijjamānena Avijjamāna
Paññatti</em>), Concept of the Real by means of the Unreal
(<em>Avijjamānena Vijjamāna Paññatti</em>), Concept of the Real by means
of the Real (<em>Vijjamānena Vijjamāna Paññatti</em>), and Concept of
the Unreal by means of the Unreal (<em>Avijjamānena Avijjamāna
Paññatti</em>).</p>
<p>The name stating Form, Feeling etc. existing as Ultimate Reality is
Concept of the Real. Names like Citta, Phassa, Vedanā, Saññā, Cetanā,
Paṭhavī, Āpo etc. are <strong>Concepts of the Real</strong>.</p>
<p>Names referring to things not existing as Ultimate Reality like
tables, chairs, clothes etc. are Concepts of the Unreal. Concepts like
table, chair, cloth, earth, rock, Deva, human, child etc. are
<strong>Concepts of the Unreal</strong>.</p>
<p>Names indicating an unreal thing taking a thing existing as Ultimate
Reality as a sign, such as Wise person, Faithful person, Envious person,
Greedy person, White man etc., are <strong>Concepts of the Unreal by
means of the Real</strong>. Wisdom is an Ultimate Reality Dhamma. Person
does not exist as Ultimate Reality. Therefore, Wise person is a Concept
of the Unreal by means of the Real. Faith is an Ultimate Reality Dhamma.
Person is unreal in Ultimate sense. Therefore, Faithful person is a
Concept of the Unreal by means of the Real. White is an Ultimate Reality
Dhamma. It is Color Rūpa. Man is unreal. Therefore, White man is a
Concept of the Unreal by means of the Real.</p>
<p>Names indicating a real thing taking an unreal thing as a sign, such
as Woman’s wisdom, Vīṇā sound, Child’s mind etc., are <strong>Concepts
of the Real by means of the Unreal</strong>.</p>
<p>Names like Eye-Consciousness (<em>Cakkhu-viññāṇa</em>),
Ear-Consciousness (<em>Sota-viññāṇa</em>) etc., indicating something
existing as Ultimate Reality taking something existing as Ultimate
Reality as a sign, are <strong>Concepts of the Real by means of the
Real</strong>. In Eye-Consciousness, both Eye Sensitivity referred to by
the name <em>Cakkhu</em> and Citta referred to by the name
<em>Viññāṇa</em> are things existing as Ultimate Reality.</p>
<p>Names like Female child, Male son etc., indicating an unreal thing
taking an unreal thing as a sign, are <strong>Concepts of the Unreal by
means of the Unreal</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="compendium-of-meditation-subjects">1. Compendium of Meditation
Subjects</h2>
<p>The high fruit to be obtained by learning and knowing the
Name-and-Matter analysis with conditions shown in the previous eight
chapters is: relying on that knowledge, engaging in meditation, removing
the group of defilements led by Ignorance and Craving which are the
cause of all suffering, purifying one’s own continuity, and realizing
the Supramundane Element of Nibbāna directly. The true nature of
extremely deep Ultimate Realities cannot be known merely by book
learning. Ordinary knowledge not developed by strategy is not sufficient
to find and see the nature of those Dhammas correctly. To be able to
understand those Dhammas correctly, concentration and wisdom developed
by engaging in meditation are needed. Therefore, to be able to clarify
the Dhamma knowledge obtained by learning, one must engage in
meditation. To be able to develop Dhamma knowledge and to realize
Nibbāna, one must practice some meditation shown in this chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Meditation Subjects (<em>Kammaṭṭhāna</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Concepts such as Kasiṇas and Name-and-Form Dhammas taken as objects
by meditators for their yoga action are called <strong>Meditation
Subjects</strong>. The meaning of the word <strong>Kammaṭṭhāna</strong>
is: ‘the thing that is the place for yoga action’. The yoga action or
meditation performed first and first is also called Meditation Subject
because it is the foundation for the meditation performed later and
later. There are two types of Meditation Subjects: Calm Meditation
Subject (<em>Samatha Kammaṭṭhāna</em>) and Insight Meditation Subject
(<em>Vipassanā Kammaṭṭhāna</em>).</p>
<p>The One-pointedness that calms defilements like Lust and certain
gross mental factors like Initial Application is called
<strong>Calm</strong> (<em>Samatha</em>). Concentration
(<em>Samādhi</em>) is also a name for it. Concepts such as Kasiṇas which
are places for Concentration Meditation are called Calm Meditation
Subjects. The meditation performed taking them as object is also called
Calm Meditation Subject. The high thing that can be obtained from Calm
Meditation Subject is Jhāna, Direct Knowledge (<em>Abhiññā</em>), and
birth in a Good Destination (<em>Sugati</em>). That Concentration is
also helpful for Insight (<em>Vipassanā</em>).</p>
<p>The wisdom that sees the Five Aggregates—which are seen by ordinary
people as beings, persons, men, women, and as eternal things, good
things—as a heap of Name-and-Form Dhammas, and specially sees them as
impermanent things, bad things, and sees the Five Aggregates as they
really are, is called ‘<strong>Insight</strong>’ (<em>Vipassanā</em>).
Name-and-Form Dhammas taken as objects of Insight and Insight
Meditations are called Insight Meditation Subjects. Giving Supramundane
Paths and Fruits and leading the being to Nibbāna is done by Insight
Meditation Subject.</p>
<p><strong>The Forty Calm Meditation Subjects</strong></p>
<p>There are forty Calm Meditation Subjects: ten Kasiṇas, ten Foulnesses
(<em>Asubha</em>), ten Recollections (<em>Anussati</em>), four
Illimitables (<em>Appamaññā</em>), one Perception (<em>Saññā</em>), one
Analysis (<em>Vavatthāna</em>), and four Immaterial States
(<em>Āruppa</em>).</p>
<p><strong>The Ten Kasiṇas</strong></p>
<p>Ten Kasiṇas: Earth Kasiṇa, Water Kasiṇa, Fire Kasiṇa, Air Kasiṇa,
Blue Kasiṇa, Yellow Kasiṇa, Red Kasiṇa, White Kasiṇa, Space Kasiṇa, and
Light Kasiṇa.</p>
<p>The circle made of clay taken by meditators for establishing
(concentration) is called ‘Earth Kasiṇa’. When taking any Kasiṇa small,
it should be about one span and four inches in size. When taking it
large, it is also proper to take a Kasiṇa the size of a winnowing fan or
a threshing floor. For Earth Kasiṇa, moderately red clay should be
taken. Dark red clay or clay of another color should not be taken to
make the Kasiṇa. It is suitable to apply clay on the ground itself or on
something like a plank and make it. The clay should be kneaded well and
made smooth without holes. Kasiṇas are called so for earth circles etc.
because they should be meditated upon taking them as object everywhere
during meditation.</p>
<p>Water located in a circular shape is ‘Water Kasiṇa’. Water with any
strange color should not be taken for Water Kasiṇa. Water Kasiṇa
meditation can be done by filling a vessel with a round mouth like a
bowl with clean water.</p>
<p>Fire appearing in a circular shape is ‘Fire Kasiṇa’. Having prepared
a fire heap with good firewood, placing a sheet with a circular hole of
about one span and four inches near that fire, Fire Kasiṇa meditation
can be done taking the fire visible through that hole as object.</p>
<p>The column of wind considered by one’s mind according to something
touched by wind is ‘Air Kasiṇa’. Air Kasiṇa meditation can be done by
considering a stream of air by one’s own mind as if existing according
to something seen moving by being touched by wind, or by remembering the
wind touching one’s body coming through some hole.</p>
<p>The circle having blue color is ‘Blue Kasiṇa’. The circle having
yellow color is ‘Yellow Kasiṇa’. The circle having red color is ‘Red
Kasiṇa’. The circle having white color is ‘White Kasiṇa’. Color Kasiṇas
can be made by applying paints of respective colors on something. They
can also be made from colored paper and cloth. Cutting a hole of about
one span and four inches in a thick paper and placing a paper of the
required color under it is a method to make Color Kasiṇas very
easily.</p>
<p>Space circle is ‘Space Kasiṇa’. Space Kasiṇa meditation can be done
by making a hole of one span and four inches in something and
contemplating the space inside that hole.</p>
<p>Light circle is ‘Light Kasiṇa’. Light Kasiṇa meditation can be done
by making light fall on the ground or a wall etc. in a size of one span
and four inches and looking at that light. Light Kasiṇa can be made by
making a hole in a tin, lighting a lamp inside, and letting the light
fall on some place through the hole. It can also be made from a clay
pot. Where there is electricity, Light Kasiṇa can be made very
easily.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ten Foulnesses (<em>Asubha</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Ten Foulnesses: Bloated corpse (<em>Uddhumātaka</em>), Livid corpse
(<em>Vinīlaka</em>), Festering corpse (<em>Vipubbaka</em>), Cut up
corpse (<em>Vicchiddaka</em>), Gnawed corpse (<em>Vikkhāyitaka</em>),
Scattered corpse (<em>Vikkhittaka</em>), Hacked and Scattered corpse
(<em>Hatavikkhittaka</em>), Bleeding corpse (<em>Lohitaka</em>),
Worm-infested corpse (<em>Puḷavaka</em>), and Skeleton
(<em>Aṭṭhika</em>).</p>
<p>A swollen dead body is <strong>Bloated</strong>. A dead body turned
blue and swollen is <strong>Livid</strong>. A dead body festering and
oozing pus from places is <strong>Festering</strong>. A dead body cut in
two on battlefields etc. is <strong>Cut up</strong>. A dead body eaten
here and there by dogs, jackals etc. is <strong>Gnawed</strong>. A dead
body broken into pieces and dragged here and there by dogs, jackals etc.
is <strong>Scattered</strong>. A dead body wounded all over like crow’s
feet and then broken into pieces and scattered is <strong>Hacked and
Scattered</strong>. A dead body flowing with blood is
<strong>Bleeding</strong>. A dead body full of worms is
<strong>Worm-infested</strong>. The collection of bones without blood
and flesh is <strong>Skeleton</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The Ten Recollections (<em>Anussati</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Ten Recollection Meditation Subjects: Recollection of the Buddha,
Recollection of the Dhamma, Recollection of the Sangha, Recollection of
Virtue, Recollection of Generosity, Recollection of Devas, Recollection
of Peace, Recollection of Death, Mindfulness Occupied with the Body, and
Mindfulness of Breathing.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Remembering the virtues of the Buddha such as Arahant etc. is
<strong>Recollection of the Buddha</strong>.</li>
<li>Remembering the virtues of the Dhamma such as well-expounded etc. is
<strong>Recollection of the Dhamma</strong>.</li>
<li>Remembering the virtues of the Sangha such as practicing well etc.
is <strong>Recollection of the Sangha</strong>.</li>
<li>Remembering one’s own virtue is <strong>Recollection of
Virtue</strong>.</li>
<li>Remembering one’s own generosity is <strong>Recollection of
Generosity</strong>.</li>
<li>Remembering one’s own virtues like faith etc. which lead to
divinity, keeping gods as witnesses, is <strong>Recollection of
Devas</strong>.</li>
<li>Remembering the virtues of Nibbāna which is the subsiding of all
suffering is <strong>Recollection of Peace</strong>.</li>
<li>Remembering death is <strong>Recollection of Death</strong>.</li>
<li>Remembering body parts such as hair etc. is <strong>Mindfulness
Occupied with the Body</strong>.</li>
<li>Remembering in-breath and out-breath air is <strong>Mindfulness of
Breathing</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Loving-kindness, Compassion, Appreciative Joy, Equanimity—these four
are <strong>Illimitables</strong>. <strong>Brahma-vihāra</strong> is
also a name for them.</p>
<p>One Perception is the Perception of Loathsomeness in Food.
Remembering the repulsiveness of food in manifold ways.</p>
<p>One Analysis is viewing the four elements Earth, Water, Fire, Air in
the body separately by way of characteristics etc. It is called
“Analysis of Four Elements.”</p>
<p>Four Immaterial States are the four objects such as Space Concept
taken from the Kasiṇa, which are objects for the four Immaterial Jhānas
starting with Base of Infinite Space.</p>
<p>Thus, the forty Meditation Subjects have been briefly shown.</p>
<p><strong>The Three Developments (<em>Bhāvanā</em>)</strong></p>
<p>There are three Developments: Preliminary Development (<em>Parikamma
Bhāvanā</em>), Access Development (<em>Upacāra Bhāvanā</em>), and
Absorption Development (<em>Appanā Bhāvanā</em>).</p>
<p>Establishing the mind on an object like Kasiṇa etc. and practicing so
that object appears to the mind as if visible to the eye by reflecting
on it again and again—that meditation of the meditator is named
<strong>Preliminary Development</strong>.</p>
<p>From the time the meditation object is taken to the mind and
hindrances like Sensual Desire are suppressed until getting close to the
arising of Absorption Consciousness, the meditation is named
<strong>Access Development</strong>.</p>
<p>The meditation that has reached Sublime and Supramundane state is
<strong>Absorption Development</strong>.</p>
<p>Since it exists as if entering the object, Initial Application
(<em>Vitakka</em>) is Absorption (<em>Appanā</em>). Since it exists as
the main factor, that name is used for all Sublime and Supramundane
Jhāna Dhammas.</p>
<p><strong>The Three Signs (<em>Nimitta</em>)</strong></p>
<p>There are three Signs: Preliminary Sign (<em>Parikamma Nimitta</em>),
Learning Sign (<em>Uggaha Nimitta</em>), and Counterpart Sign
(<em>Paṭibhāga Nimitta</em>). Starting meditation first, the meditation
sign of the meditator taking the sign in earth circle etc. to the mind
is called <strong>Preliminary Sign</strong>. The meditation sign that
starts appearing to the mind as if visible to the eye is called
<strong>Learning Sign</strong>. When remembering the Learning Sign, as
hindrances are further removed and the mind becomes pure, the meditation
sign appears to the mind very purely, free from all defects. That very
pure meditation sign is called <strong>Counterpart Sign</strong>.</p>

<li>The Six Temperaments - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-six-temperaments">2. The Six Temperaments</h2>
<p><strong>Lesson 3</strong></p>
<p>There are many meditation subjects not for everyone to develop all of
them, but to choose meditation subjects that suit them best and
meditate. It is difficult to obtain concentration by developing an
unsuitable meditation subject. One who meditates choosing a suitable
meditation subject can obtain concentration quickly. The meditation
subject is chosen according to Temperament (<em>Carita</em>).</p>
<p>There are six Temperaments: Lustful Temperament, Hateful Temperament,
Deluded Temperament, Faithful Temperament, Intelligent Temperament, and
Discursive Temperament. Temperament is the nature of respective
individuals. Since everyone has lust, hatred etc., understanding
Temperament is very difficult.</p>
<p>The person in whom lust arises often, who has abundant lust, is
Lustful Temperament. Lust is Greed. Since Conceit is a Cetasika existing
with Greed, Conceit is also excessive for the Lustful Temperament.
Attaching strongly to persons and objects, not being satisfied however
much received, protecting more than necessary, being very greedy for
food, drink, clothes, ornaments etc., doing work beautifully, keeping
body, clothes, ornaments, dwelling, and one’s goods beautiful, liking
beautiful things etc. are characteristics of the Lustful
Temperament.</p>
<p>The person who often hates others, who has abundant hatred, is
Hateful Temperament. Envy, Avarice, and Worry arising with Hatred are
also abundant for the Hateful Temperament. Getting angry often, getting
angry for very small reasons, getting angry even without reason, bearing
grudges, inability to live as friends with others for long, being
agitated in every matter, being afraid, changing quickly, not having
much attachment to anything, liking harsh food etc. are characteristics
of the Hateful Temperament.</p>
<p>The person with excessive Delusion is Deluded Temperament. Sloth and
Torpor, Restlessness, Worry, Doubt—these are also excessive for the
Deluded Temperament. Inability to understand deep facts, being easily
deceived, considering right and wrong/good and bad according to others’
words, difficulty in making give up accepted wrong views, inability to
do anything properly etc. are characteristics of the Deluded
Temperament.</p>
<p>The person with excessive Faith is Faithful Temperament. Liking to
give, liking to see virtuous ones, liking to hear Dhamma, becoming
pleased in those worthy of pleasing, abundant joy etc. are
characteristics of the Faithful Temperament. In certain aspects, the
Faithful Temperament is similar to the Lustful Temperament.</p>
<p>The person with more wisdom is Intelligent Temperament. Being
obedient, having good friends, knowing moderation in food, having
mindfulness and wisdom, being capable of understanding deep things,
acting with investigation, not accepting just because others said so,
doing everything systematically etc. are characteristics of the
Intelligent Temperament. In some aspects, the Intelligent Temperament is
similar to the Hateful Temperament.</p>
<p>The person with abundant discursive thoughts (<em>Vitakka</em>) is
Discursive Temperament. Difficulty in concentrating the mind, talking
much, associating with many people, constantly thinking about various
things, lack of happiness in doing merit, changing ideas quickly etc.
are characteristics of the Discursive Temperament. In certain aspects,
the Discursive Temperament is similar to the Deluded Temperament.</p>
<p><strong>Meditation Subjects Suitable for Temperament</strong></p>
<p>The ten Foulnesses and Mindfulness Occupied with the Body—these
eleven meditation subjects are suitable for the Lustful Temperament.
Mindfulness Occupied with the Body is meditation on parts like hair etc.
For the Lustful Temperament, what is especially an obstacle to
concentration is Lust. These eleven meditation subjects are opposed to
Lust. They are meditations that remove Lust. Therefore, they are
suitable (<em>sappāya</em>) for the Lustful Temperament.</p>
<p>The four Illimitables and the four Kasiṇas: Blue, Yellow, Red,
White—these eight meditation subjects are suitable for the Hateful
Temperament. If Illimitables are meditated upon, for the Lustful
Temperament, lust may sometimes arise regarding the persons who are
objects of meditation. Lust may also arise regarding colors like blue.
Therefore, they are unsuitable for the Lustful Temperament. When
meditating taking Foulness as object, hatred or dissatisfaction
regarding the meditation object may arise for the Hateful Temperament.
Therefore, Foulness meditation is unsuitable for the Hateful
Temperament.</p>
<p>Mindfulness of Breathing meditation is suitable for the Deluded
Temperament and Discursive Temperament. The Deluded Temperament is also
a distracted person like the Discursive Temperament. In-breath and
out-breath, which occur again and again without stopping in the person,
exist as if calling the scattering mind back to themselves. Therefore,
it is especially suitable for Deluded and Discursive Temperaments.</p>
<p>The six meditation subjects: Recollection of Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha,
Virtue, Generosity, Devas are suitable for the Faithful Temperament as
they are pleasant to the person abundant in faith.</p>
<p>Recollection of Death, Recollection of Peace, Perception of
Loathsomeness in Food, and Analysis of Four Elements—these four
meditation subjects are suitable for the Intelligent Temperament. Since
they are deep, they are suitable for the Intelligent Temperament. They
are not more suitable for others.</p>
<p>The ten meditation subjects: Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Space, Light
Kasiṇas and four Immaterial States are suitable for everyone.</p>
<p>In meditating on Kasiṇas, a large Kasiṇa circle is suitable for the
Deluded Temperament. When developing a small Kasiṇa, the mind of the
Deluded Temperament may become more deluded. A small Kasiṇa circle of
about one span and four inches is suitable for the Discursive
Temperament. Because when meditating on a large Kasiṇa circle, the mind
of the Discursive Temperament goes to its parts. Kasiṇa meditation is
something that should be done by taking the entire circle at once to the
mind.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meditation Subjects Obtaining/Not Obtaining Respective
Developments</strong></p>
<p>Preliminary Development is obtained in all forty Meditation Subjects.
In the ten meditation subjects: Recollection of Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha,
Virtue, Generosity, Devas, Peace, Death, Perception of Loathsomeness in
Food, Analysis of Four Elements, only Access Development is
accomplished. Absorption Development does not occur. Absorption
Development not occurring means Jhānas cannot be obtained from those ten
meditations. Jhānas can be obtained from an object where the mind can be
established easily and made apparent. Since Buddha virtues etc. are deep
and many, it is difficult to grasp them well to the mind and establish
the mind unmoving in them. Therefore, from the said ten meditation
subjects, only Access Concentration can be generated, not Fine-Material
and Immaterial Jhānas. Jhānas can be generated only from the remaining
thirty meditation subjects.</p>
<p>Not all Jhānas can be generated from all meditation subjects capable
of generating Jhānas. The Jhānas that can be generated from respective
meditation subjects should be known as shown below.</p>
<p>From the eleven meditation subjects: ten Kasiṇas and Mindfulness of
Breathing, all five Jhānas can be generated.</p>
<p>From the eleven meditation subjects: ten Foulnesses and Mindfulness
Occupied with the Body, only the First Jhāna can be generated. The
meditator who generated the First Jhāna from them must develop another
meditation subject to generate Second Jhāna etc. In dead bodies and foul
parts like hair, body hair etc., there is only a nature that pushes away
the mind of the person remembering them, not a nature that attracts the
mind. In repulsive objects that have a nature creating disgust in the
mind and not even a little nature creating pleasure and attracting to
itself, the mind is established by the power of Initial Application
(<em>Vitakka</em>). In Second etc. Jhānas, there is no Vitakka carrying
the mind to the object. Therefore, Jhānas without Vitakka do not arise
in repulsive objects.</p>
<p>From the three meditation subjects: Loving-kindness, Compassion,
Appreciative Joy, the four Jhānas: First, Second, Third, Fourth can be
generated. The Fifth Jhāna cannot be obtained from them. Loving-kindness
is a Dhamma opposed to Ill Will arising from displeasure. Compassion is
a Dhamma opposed to Cruelty arising from displeasure. Appreciative Joy
is a Dhamma opposed to Discontent (<em>Arati</em>) arising from
displeasure. Therefore, for Loving-kindness, Compassion, and
Appreciative Joy to exist powerfully, Joy (<em>Somanassa</em>) must be
present. Since the four Jhānas starting with First are Joy-Accompanied,
those Jhānas can be generated from Loving-kindness etc. three. Since the
Fifth Jhāna is Equanimity-Accompanied, it cannot be generated from
Loving-kindness etc. three.</p>
<p>Only the Fifth Jhāna can be generated from the Equanimity Meditation
Subject. Since Equanimity meditation is something to be done with
neutrality towards beings, only an Equanimity-Accompanied Jhāna, not a
Joy-Accompanied Jhāna, can be generated from it.</p>
<p>The four Immaterial Objects such as Space obtained by removal of
Kasiṇa are meditation subjects generating Immaterial Jhānas.</p>
<p><strong>Meditation Signs</strong></p>
<p>Among signs, Preliminary Sign and Learning Sign are obtained
appropriately from all meditation subjects. Counterpart Sign is obtained
only from the twenty-two meditation subjects: ten Kasiṇas, ten
Foulnesses, Hair etc. Parts meditation, and Mindfulness of Breathing.
Access and Absorption Concentrations arise taking the Counterpart Sign
as object.</p>

<li>Kasiṇa Meditation - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="kasiṇa-meditation">3. Kasiṇa Meditation</h2>
<p><strong>Lesson 5</strong></p>
<p>There are three parts of merit: Giving (<em>Dāna</em>), Virtue
(<em>Sīla</em>), and Meditation (<em>Bhāvanā</em>). All results
obtainable from Giving and Virtue are obtained from Meditation Merit as
well. However, the high results and high benefits obtained from
Meditation Merit can be obtained only from Meditation Merit, not from
Giving and Virtue. Therefore, know that Meditation Merit is the superior
merit among merits.</p>
<p>The highest thing to be obtained by practicing according to the
Buddha’s Dhamma is Nibbāna. It can be obtained by developing wisdom.
Aside from developing wisdom, there is no other way to obtain it. Until
the Supramundane Wisdom giving Nibbāna arises, the only thing to do to
develop wisdom is Insight Meditation (<em>Vipassanā</em>). Even with
meditation, for wisdom to develop, concentration must also be present.
Therefore, Calm Meditation (<em>Samatha</em>) should be done to develop
concentration. To obtain the high fruits to be obtained by believing in
Buddhism, every Buddhist must do some meditation.</p>
<p>There are two methods of meditating. What is described in books like
Visuddhimagga is the method of meditating to obtain Jhāna, Path, and
Fruit in the present existence itself. That too is a method done not by
a layperson but by a monk. It is a very difficult work program to do. It
can be done only by special individuals who have the courage to give up
all other hopes in life and dedicate life solely to obtaining Dhammas
like Jhāna. Such people are rare in the world. There is only one in tens
of thousands. Engaging in meditation as much as possible while doing
one’s other work to obtain Meditation Merit and to habituate it for
Saṃsāra is the other method of meditating. The person doing so should
separate a certain amount of his time for meditation and do some
meditation during that time.</p>
<p><strong>The purpose of meditating is to elevate the state of the
mind.</strong> To develop the mind. Each person has two (two bodies):
Name-Body (<em>Nāma-Kāya</em>) and Form-Body (<em>Rūpa-Kāya</em>).
Form-Body is the body visible to the eye. Name-Body is the stream of
consciousness elements located inside that Form-Body, governing the
Form-Body, handling the Form-Body. If the Name-Body departs from the
body, there is no use to be taken from the Form-Body after that. It
becomes something to be buried in the soil. The Form-Body of the present
existence is not connected to the Form-Body received in the future
existence. What connects to the future existence lineage is the
Name-Body, which is the stream of consciousness of the being. Therefore,
know that the main part of the being is not the Form-Body, but the
Name-Body. The essence of the being is also that. Therefore, greater
care should be given to the Name-Body.</p>
<p>However, many people spend their entire time improving, protecting,
and decorating the Form-Body, and do nothing about the Name-Body. They
do not know that it should be improved or protected. The loss, the
suffering occurring due to harm to the Form-Body is only for one
existence. Harm to the lineage of existence occurs due to the Name-Body
becoming bad. Therefore, a certain part of one’s time should be kept to
improve and protect the Name-Body. At least half an hour out of the
twenty-four hours in a day should be separated for that. Do some
meditation during that time.</p>
<p>Virtue is the foundation of meditation. Therefore, the person
meditating, if a layperson, should be established in virtue suitable for
a layperson, and if a monk, in virtue suitable for a monk, and meditate.
By saying this, one should not think that if a person without pure
virtue meditates, there will be no benefit or there will be harm.
Meditation is suitable even for a person without pure virtue. Even if
virtue is impure, if one meditates, Meditation Merit is obtained. When
meditating for some time, the strength to protect virtue gradually comes
to him from it.</p>
<p>Among meditation subjects, Earth Kasiṇa is a meditation subject
suitable for everyone. Meditation subjects suitable for temperament
should be sought by those meditating to obtain Jhāna etc. in this world
itself. Generally, any meditation subject is fine for those
meditating.</p>
<p>Earth Kasiṇa can be made without much difficulty. For that, moderate
red clay should be taken. If dark red clay is taken, it confuses with
Red Kasiṇa. Sticks and stones should be removed and the clay should be
kneaded well. If there is a tray about ten or eleven inches in diameter
by the ruler, put that clay in it, level it, dry it, and it becomes the
Earth Kasiṇa. Sometimes its levelness might be lost during drying. If
so, apply clay on top again and level it.</p>
<p>Making Earth Kasiṇa on a plank is as follows: Cut a plank round to
the size of the Kasiṇa. Hammer small nails about every two inches all
over it so they protrude about half an inch. Then put seasoned red clay
on it, cover the nails, and make the circle like a roti. Nails should be
hammered to prevent the clay layer from detaching from the plank after
drying. If levelness is lost after drying, level it again. If rounding
the plank is difficult, draw a circle on a square plank, hammer nails in
it, and make the Kasiṇa circle. It is suitable to make the Kasiṇa circle
even on the ground in a suitable quiet place. When making the Kasiṇa
circle, a strong circle can be made by mixing a little cement with clay.
After the Kasiṇa circle made mixing cement dries, apply only clay thinly
on top and level it.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 6</strong></p>
<p>Take the Kasiṇa circle made as said to a quiet place with less noise
where people do not come, prepare a seat about one span and four inches
high to sit, place the circle on the ground about two and a half cubits
away from it, sit cross-legged on the seat, and meditate looking at the
Kasiṇa circle. It is very good to bathe in water, clean the body, wear
clean clothes, and sit for meditation. Since it cannot be done always,
if there are unclean places on the body, clean them and sit for
meditation. Sitting down, first recall the virtues of the Triple Gem as
you know them and gladden the mind.</p>
<p>If virtues of the entire Triple Gem cannot be recalled, recall at
least Buddha virtues and generate joy. Then spread loving-kindness to
guardian deities and all beings a few times.</p>
<p>Then thinking “I too go on the path gone by Supreme Buddhas etc., by
this practice I too will arrive at Nibbāna arrived at by Supreme Buddhas
etc.,” generate effort, keep eyes directed at the Kasiṇa circle without
opening too much or closing too much, determine two or three times “May
my mind be established right here, may it not go outside of this,” grasp
the Kasiṇa circle with the mind as if grasping something with the hand,
establish the mind in the Kasiṇa circle, keep the body still, and dwell
contemplating “Earth - Earth” (<em>Paṭhavī - Paṭhavī</em>) or “Earth -
Earth” (<em>Pas - Pas</em> in Sinhala) without blinking.</p>
<p>For a meditator, the difficult matter is conquering the body.
Conquering the body means bringing it to a state where the body can be
kept still for an hour or two without difficulty. Concentration is not
obtained until the body can be kept still. When unable to look with eyes
open, close eyes and remember the Kasiṇa. When remembering the Kasiṇa
with eyes closed, if the Kasiṇa appears to the mind as when looking with
eyes open, dwell remembering it and establishing the mind right there
without opening eyes. If not seen, open eyes again, look, and
meditate.</p>
<p>Do not move the body because a fly landed on the body, an ant walked
on the body, or a mosquito bit. Endure all that. Staying still is an
unaccustomed task for the body. Therefore, when staying motionless,
various pains arise in various places of the body. Endure them with
patience. In time, the body will adjust and a strange comfort will be
felt when staying motionless without pains arising.</p>
<p>When remembering the Kasiṇa circle with eyes closed, various other
things might appear along with the Kasiṇa circle. There is no benefit or
harm from them. Pay no attention to them. If you become happy about
those appearing things and expect them, endless various things might
start appearing and meditation might get confused. Even during the time
of looking with eyes open, various things might appear. None of those
appearing things exist in truth. Do not be deceived by them. Various
things start appearing during the time concentration develops
somewhat.</p>
<p>During the time engaged in meditation, sometimes very small sounds
not heard when staying normally start to be heard. Do not pay attention
to them thinking “strange sounds are heard.” Small sounds like a
cockroach or gecko moving might be heard as loud sounds. No matter how
loud a sound is heard, ignore it and continue your meditation properly.
Sometimes light might appear. There is no benefit for meditation from
that either. Therefore, ignoring anything strange seen or heard, without
directing the mind to anything, contemplate the Kasiṇa circle itself
with effort.</p>
<p>If one engages in meditation daily for about an hour as said for
several months, some concentration will arise. After that, meditation
will become sweet to him. It will become a pleasure. Mindfulness and
wisdom will develop to some extent. The person who obtained
concentration will be a peaceful person living free from sin.</p>
<p>For meditators with past merit who continue Earth Kasiṇa meditation
in the correct method with great effort, removing all faults, with the
hope of obtaining Jhāna in the present existence itself, when continuing
for some time, even when remembering the Kasiṇa circle with eyes closed,
the Kasiṇa circle starts appearing to the mind just as it appears when
looking with eyes open without any confusion. The Kasiṇa sign seen thus
is called <strong>Learning Sign</strong> (<em>Uggaha Nimitta</em>).</p>
<p>If the Learning Sign is obtained, one should not sit near the Kasiṇa
circle but go to another place, sit comfortably, and start contemplating
the Learning Sign. The Learning Sign is also contemplated as “Earth,
Earth.” The Learning Sign is something that vanishes quickly if engaged
in other work. It should be protected with great effort without letting
it vanish.</p>
<p>For the meditator who obtained the Learning Sign and engages in
meditation taking it as object, the Five Hindrances subside to a great
extent. The mind also subsides to a great extent by Access
Concentration. As the meditator continues meditation taking the Learning
Sign as object, when Hindrances are further suppressed and the mind
becomes clear, at a certain occasion, the Kasiṇa circle starts appearing
very brightly like a polished gold disk, like the morning sun disk. That
brightly appearing Kasiṇa sign is called <strong>Counterpart
Sign</strong> (<em>Paṭibhāga Nimitta</em>). For the meditator continuing
meditation taking the Counterpart Sign as object, as Hindrances are
further removed and concentration develops, at a certain occasion in
that object, the <strong>First Fine-material-sphere Jhāna
Consciousness</strong> consisting of five factors: Initial Application,
Sustained Application, Zest, Happiness, One-pointedness arises. That
Jhāna Consciousness is also called <strong>Absorption
Consciousness</strong> (<em>Appanā Citta</em>).</p>
<p>No matter how developed a Sense-Sphere Javana Consciousness is, it
arises only seven times in an object adverted once. After that, it
becomes Bhavanga. The Fine-material-sphere Jhāna Consciousness, once
generated by adverting to the object, arises again and again as that
very Citta without falling into Bhavanga even for the whole day.
<strong>That is the difference between Sense-Sphere Consciousness and
Absorption Consciousness.</strong></p>

<li>The Second and Higher Jhānas - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-second-and-higher-jhānas">4. The Second and Higher
Jhānas</h2>
<p><strong>Lesson 7</strong></p>
<p>For the meditator who obtained the First Jhāna to be able to obtain
the Second Jhāna, he must develop the fivefold Mastery
(<em>Vasībhāva</em>) in the First Jhāna: Adverting Mastery (<em>Āvajjana
Vasī</em>), Attainment Mastery (<em>Samāpajjana Vasī</em>), Resolution
Mastery (<em>Adhiṭṭhāna Vasī</em>), Emergence Mastery (<em>Vuṭṭhāna
Vasī</em>), and Reviewing Mastery (<em>Paccavekkhana Vasī</em>). The
ability to advert to the factors of the First Jhāna one by one very
quickly without delay is <strong>Adverting Mastery</strong>. The ability
to enter the Jhāna quickly without delay when wishing to enter is
<strong>Attainment Mastery</strong>. The ability to maintain the
attained Jhāna even for a short time like a second or two is
<strong>Resolution Mastery</strong>. The ability to emerge from Jhāna
exactly at the time without letting the resolved time pass is
<strong>Emergence Mastery</strong>. It is the general nature that
Sense-Sphere Javana arises seven times in each process. The ability to
review Jhāna factors very quickly so that even seven Javanas do not
arise in Reviewing Processes when reviewing Vitakka etc. is
<strong>Reviewing Mastery</strong>.</p>
<p>To the meditator who has thus developed Mastery in the First Jhāna,
Vitakka, which is a factor of the First Jhāna, appears as a gross thing,
and obtaining Jhāna without it appears as good. Desiring to obtain a
Jhāna free from Vitakka, he starts contemplating the Earth Kasiṇa
Counterpart again as ‘Earth, Earth’. Since his meditation is done to
remove the gross Jhāna factor called Vitakka, it is called
<strong>Vitakka Dispassion Meditation</strong> (<em>Vitakka Virāga
Bhāvanā</em>). By the power of that Vitakka Dispassion Meditation, at a
certain occasion, the Second Jhāna Consciousness consisting of the four
factors: Vicāra, Pīti, Sukha, Ekaggatā arises to him in that Earth
Kasiṇa Sign.</p>
<p>To the meditator who has developed Mastery in the Second Jhāna,
Vicāra starts appearing as a gross factor. To the meditator who obtained
the Third Jhāna and developed Mastery, Pīti appears as a gross factor,
and to the meditator who obtained the Fourth Jhāna, Sukha appears as a
gross factor. By doing preliminary work on the Earth Kasiṇa Sign with
the intention of transcending the gross factor, the Third, Fourth, and
Fifth Jhānas also arise gradually. Generating Jhānas from the remaining
nine Kasiṇas such as Water Kasiṇa etc. is also done in the same stated
method.</p>
<p><strong>Immaterial Jhānas</strong></p>
<p>The meditator who obtained Jhāna from one Kasiṇa can generate the
sign by thinking of those respective Kasiṇas without making Kasiṇa
circles and meditating, and bring his Jhāna to any desired Kasiṇa. Also,
Kasiṇa signs can be enlarged mentally to the desired size. Immaterial
Jhānas are generated by doing preliminary work on the Space Sign
extracted from Kasiṇa Signs. Space can be extracted from the other nine
Kasiṇas excluding the Space Kasiṇa. Another space cannot be obtained
from the Space Kasiṇa Sign.</p>
<p>The meditator wishing to generate Immaterial Jhānas must first
develop the fivefold Mastery in the Fine-material-sphere Fifth Jhāna.
Then, entering the Fifth Jhāna of a Kasiṇa other than Space Kasiṇa,
rising from it, the Kasiṇa Sign which was the object of the Jhāna
Consciousness should be spread out. Spreading out means making the
Kasiṇa Sign large. As the meditator thinks, the Kasiṇa Sign starts
appearing large to him. Then, if that enlarged Kasiṇa Sign is Earth
Kasiṇa Sign, without thinking of it as earth, one should think
“<strong>Space - Space</strong>” or “<strong>Infinite Space - Infinite
Space</strong>.” When meditating thus, the material Kasiṇa Sign
disappears, and space starts appearing in the place where that Kasiṇa
Sign appeared. Since it is taken from the Kasiṇa, that appearing space
is called “<strong>Space obtained by removal of Kasiṇa</strong>”
(<em>Kasiṇugghāṭimākāsa</em>). Its meaning is space extracted from
Kasiṇa. To the meditator engaging in meditation saying Infinite Space
establishing the mind in the <em>Kasiṇugghāṭimākāsa</em>, at a certain
occasion, the Ākāsānañcāyatana Jhāna Consciousness, which is the First
Immaterial Jhāna Consciousness, arises in that object.</p>
<p>The meditator who mastered the Ākāsānañcāyatana Jhāna, in order to
move further away from matter, abandons the Space Object, takes the
Ākāsānañcāyatana Consciousness which existed taking space as object, and
starts meditating saying “<strong>Consciousness is infinite,
Consciousness is infinite</strong>” (<em>Viññāṇaṃ anantaṃ</em>) taking
it as object. To the meditator doing so, at a certain occasion, the
Viññāṇañcāyatana Jhāna Consciousness, which is the Second Immaterial
Jhāna Consciousness, arises taking the First Immaterial Consciousness as
object.</p>
<p>To the meditator who obtained the Viññāṇañcāyatana Jhāna, the
Ākiñcaññāyatana Jhāna Consciousness arises by meditating “<strong>There
is nothing - There is nothing</strong>” (<em>Natthi kiñci - Natthi
kiñci</em>) taking the absence of the First Immaterial Consciousness as
object.</p>
<p>To the meditator who obtained the Ākiñcaññāyatana Jhāna, the
Nevasaññānāsaññāyatana Jhāna Consciousness arises by meditating taking
the Ākiñcaññāyatana Consciousness, which is the Third Immaterial Jhāna
Consciousness, as object, saying “<strong>This is peaceful, this is
excellent</strong>” (<em>Santametaṃ Paṇītametaṃ</em>).</p>

<li>Producing Direct Knowledge (Abhiññā) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="producing-direct-knowledge-abhiññā">5. Producing Direct
Knowledge (Abhiññā)</h2>
<p><strong>Lesson 8</strong></p>
<p>There are five Direct Knowledges: “<strong>Supernormal Powers
(<em>Iddhividha Abhiññā</em>), Divine Ear (<em>Dibbasota Abhiññā</em>),
Knowledge of Others’ Minds (<em>Paracittavijānana Abhiññā</em>),
Recollection of Past Lives (<em>Pubbenivāsānussati Abhiññā</em>), and
Divine Eye (<em>Dibbacakkhu Abhiññā</em>)</strong>”.</p>
<p><em>Abhiññā</em> is a name given to the Fine-material-sphere Fifth
Jhāna Consciousness possessing special power. The Fine-material-sphere
Fifth Jhāna Consciousness capable of performing disappearing, going
through the sky, walking on water, diving into the earth etc., and
creating various things is Iddhividha Abhiññā.</p>
<p>The Fine-material-sphere Fifth Jhāna capable of hearing very subtle
sounds not audible to the human ear and sounds occurring very far away
as if hearing with the ear is Divine Ear Abhiññā.</p>
<p>The Fine-material-sphere Fifth Jhāna Consciousness capable of seeing
others’ minds is Paracittavijānana Abhiññā.</p>
<p>The Fine-material-sphere Fifth Jhāna Consciousness capable of
remembering one’s past births is Pubbenivāsānussati Abhiññā.</p>
<p>The Fine-material-sphere Fifth Jhāna Consciousness capable of seeing
subtle things invisible to the human eye, distant things, and things
covered by walls, mountains etc. as if seeing with the eye is Divine Eye
Abhiññā.</p>
<p>Direct Knowledge is not obtained just by obtaining Jhāna or becoming
Arahant. Direct Knowledge power must be obtained by striving again after
obtaining Jhāna. For those who had generated Jhāna Abhiññā in near past
lives and for Great Bodhisattvas who have fulfilled perfections, Direct
Knowledge power is obtained effortlessly along with obtaining Jhāna. For
ordinary Jhāna attainers wishing to obtain Direct Knowledge, Direct
Knowledge power cannot be obtained without training the mind in the
fourteen ways shown in Visuddhimagga etc., such as “Kasiṇānulomato
Kasiṇa Paṭilomato” (Kasiṇa forward order, Kasiṇa reverse order) in the
subject of Eight Attainments (<em>Aṣṭa Samāpatti</em>).</p>
<p>There are two methods of finding Fine-material-sphere Jhānas:
Fivefold Method and Fourfold Method. In this book, Fine-material-sphere
Jhānas are shown by the Fivefold Method. In the Citta Chapter, fifteen
Fine-material-sphere Cittas are mentioned according to the Fivefold
Method of Jhānas. Certain meditators who generated the
Fine-material-sphere First Jhāna generate the Jhāna with three factors:
Pīti, Sukha, Ekaggatā, surpassing both Jhāna factors Vitakka and Vicāra
at once the second time. For them, it is the Second Jhāna. According to
the Fivefold Method, it is the Third Jhāna. They generate the Fourth
Jhāna of the Fivefold Method the third time, and the Fifth Jhāna the
fourth time. For them, there are four Fine-material-sphere Jhānas: First
Jhāna, Second Jhāna, Third Jhāna, Fourth Jhāna. The name Attainment
(<em>Samāpatti</em>) is also used for Jhānas. Therefore, the four
Fine-material-sphere Jhānas and the four Immaterial-sphere Jhānas—these
eight are called <strong>Eight Attainments</strong> (<em>Aṣṭa
Samāpatti</em>).</p>
<p>The attainer of Eight Attainments should generate
Fine-material-sphere Jhānas from all eight Kasiṇas: Earth - Water - Fire
- Air - Blue - Yellow - Red - White. Then, the Eight Attainments should
be practiced by all fourteen methods shown in Visuddhimagga, such as
entering Jhānas in order in Kasiṇas from Earth Kasiṇa to White Kasiṇa,
entering Jhānas in all Kasiṇas in reverse order from White Kasiṇa,
entering Jhānas by both those methods, etc. For the meditator who
practiced so, the power to perform psychic powers comes to the
Fine-material-sphere Fifth Jhāna Consciousness.</p>
<p>When the meditator who has developed the power of the
Fine-material-sphere Fifth Jhāna by practicing the Eight Attainments in
fourteen ways wishes to perform some special thing by its power, first
he should enter the Fifth Jhāna in a Kasiṇa suitable for the task he is
going to do. That Fifth Jhāna is called ‘Direct Knowledge Base
(<em>Abhiññā Pādaka</em>) Fifth Jhāna’. Rising from it, to create
something, he should think “May such thing be created, may it be
created” a few times and enter that Fifth Jhāna again. Rising from it,
he should resolve again “May such thing be created.” At that moment, the
Fine-material-sphere Fifth Jhāna Consciousness called Direct Knowledge
Consciousness (<em>Abhiññā Citta</em>) possessing special power arises
as resolving. With the arising of that Citta, the form intended by the
meditator appears.</p>
<p>Not all Direct Knowledges are obtained just by developing the
fourteenfold Mastery in Eight Attainments as stated above. There are
separate preliminary works (<em>Parikamma</em>) to be done for Direct
Knowledges like Divine Ear etc. Those respective Direct Knowledges exist
for meditators who have completed the preliminary works suitable for
obtaining those respective Direct Knowledges. Of Direct Knowledges, some
have only one. Some have two or three. Some have all. Therefore, certain
Jhāna attainers see the bodies of gods and Brahmas invisible to the
human eye. But they are not capable of hearing their voices. Some are
capable of hearing distant sounds. But they are not capable of seeing
distant forms. Some are capable of doing both. But they are unable to
create anything. Also know that nothing happens just by a Jhāna attainer
simply thinking or saying “let something happen.”</p>

<li>The Ten Supernormal Powers (Iddhi) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-ten-supernormal-powers-iddhi">6. The Ten Supernormal Powers
(Iddhi)</h2>
<p>There are ten Supernormal Powers: <strong>Adhiṭṭhāniddhi,
Vikubbaniddhi, Manomayiddhi, Ñāṇavipphāridhi, Samādhivipphāridhi,
Ariyiddhi, Kammavipākajiddhi, Puññiddhi, Vijjāmayiddhi,
Sammappayogapaccayiddhi</strong>.</p>
<p>One person becoming a hundred, a thousand, appearing, disappearing,
going beyond walls and mountains without sticking, diving into the earth
as in water, etc. is <strong>Adhiṭṭhāniddhi</strong> (Transformation
Power).</p>
<p>Abandoning one’s natural form and appearing like a Deva, or a Yaksha,
a Rakshasa, or an animal like a lion, tiger, etc. is
<strong>Vikubbaniddhi</strong> (Manifestation Power).</p>
<p>Creating another complete body inside one’s body by mind and taking
it out is <strong>Manomayiddhi</strong> (Mind-made Power). Only the
three powers mentioned are performed by Direct Knowledge power.
Something happening by the power of that knowledge at the time a certain
high knowledge arises, before it arises, and after it arises is
<strong>Ñāṇavipphāridhi</strong> (Knowledge-Pervading Power). If the
Arahant Path Knowledge is definitely to arise for someone in that life,
that person will not die due to any cause without obtaining it. In
childhood, Elder Bakkula was swallowed by a fish. Yet his life was
saved. That is Ñāṇavipphāridhi. The saving of Elder
<strong>Saṅkicca’s</strong> life in childhood and Elder
<strong>Bhūtapāla’s</strong> life saving are also Ñāṇavipphāridhi.</p>
<p>Something happening by the power of concentration during the time of
being in concentration, or before or after it, is
<strong>Samādhivipphāridhi</strong> (Concentration-Pervading Power).
While Elder Sāriputta was dwelling in Kapotakandara, a Yakkha struck a
heavy blow sufficient to fell even an elephant. At that moment, since he
was in attainment, the Elder felt no difficulty. That is
Samādhivipphāridhi. Humans seeing Elder <strong>Sañjīva</strong>, a
disciple of Kakusanda Buddha, dwelling in Cessation Attainment at the
foot of a tree, thinking “This recluse has died sitting,” piled wood
over the Elder and set fire. The fire burned until the wood was
finished. No harm came even to his robes from it. That is also
Samādhivipphāridhi.</p>
<p>Since the mind is mastered, Arahants can live without disgust
regarding things others find disgusting. They can also generate disgust
regarding things others consider high. They can also live neutrally
regarding both disgusting and non-disgusting things. That power of
Arahants is <strong>Ariyiddhi</strong> (Noble Power).</p>
<p>The power existing in birds, Devas, certain humans, and spirits is
<strong>Kammavipākajiddhi</strong> (Kamma-Result-Born Power). Those who
lived with power were humans of the early aeon.</p>
<p>The power of Universal Monarchs and the power established in certain
meritorious persons like Jotiya, Jaṭila etc. is
<strong>Puññiddhi</strong> (Merit Power).</p>
<p>Being able to do various things by manifold sciences existing in the
world is <strong>Vijjāmayiddhi</strong> (Knowledge-made Power).</p>
<p>Destroying defilements by Right Effort consisting of Practice, and
accomplishing various other things by strategy is
<strong>Sammappayogapaccayiddhi</strong> (Power Conditioned by Right
Effort).</p>

<li>Recollection of the Buddha - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="recollection-of-the-buddha">7. Recollection of the Buddha</h2>
<p><strong>Lesson 9</strong></p>
<p>(Since describing all Meditation Subjects in a book like this is
unsuitable, only a description of Calm Meditation Subjects useful for
everyone will be given.)</p>
<p>There are two methods of doing Recollection of the Buddha
(<em>Buddhānussati</em>). One is remembering the Buddha’s Form Body
(<em>Rūpa Kāya</em>). It is done as follows: First, go to a Buddha
statue that one likes, that one thinks is good, and look at it so that
the Buddha image is well drawn in the mind. Every part of the Buddha
image from head to foot should be looked at separately and taken to
mind. One should look at the Buddha image without blinking as much as
possible. When done so for a few days, the Buddha image is drawn in the
mind. Afterward, sitting in a quiet place, closing eyes, thinking as if
the Buddha is standing in front of oneself, remember the body of that
Buddha. When remembering, if the complete Buddha image can be
remembered, if it appears to the mind, remember so. If the complete
Buddha image does not appear, remember head - forehead - eyebrows - eyes
- nose - lips - cheeks - chin - neck - shoulders - arms - chest - belly
- waist - knees - feet in order separately. Also remember the complete
form. When practicing thus, for some, in a short time, the Buddha image
can be remembered clearly. It starts appearing as if the Buddha is
standing in front of oneself. By establishing the mind on that Buddha
image, a certain concentration can be obtained. By taking the Buddha
image as object, immense Joy based on the Buddha (<em>Buddhālambana
Pīti</em>) can be generated.</p>
<p>The other method of doing Recollection of the Buddha is remembering
the virtues of the Buddha. Buddha virtues are very many. Reflecting on
all of them is an impossible task. The person wishing to do Recollection
of the Buddha should choose some one Buddha virtue or three, four,
seven, eight virtues that are well understood by his mind and meditate
by reflecting on them. The person wishing to do this meditation should
go to a shrine room, or near a stupa, or near a Bodhi tree, or to
another quiet place, sit down, close eyes, keep the body still, and
reflect as shown below.</p>
<p>“My Blessed Buddha knew everything belonging to the three times:
past, future, present, exactly as they are without error. There is
nothing He did not know.</p>
<p>My Blessed Buddha knew the causes of everything exactly as they are,
saying this thing arises, happens due to this cause.</p>
<p>My Blessed Buddha was Greatly Compassionate. He was compassionate to
worst enemies like Devadatta just as He was to his own son Prince
Rāhula, without difference.</p>
<p>My Blessed Buddha suffered immeasurable suffering for four
incalculable aeons and a hundred thousand aeons to liberate this
multitude of beings from suffering. There is no sacrifice He did not
make to liberate these beings from Saṃsāra suffering.</p>
<p>He showed the path to obtain divine and human happiness and Nibbāna
happiness to the world beings.</p>
<p>He is supreme in the world because He lives pure having destroyed all
defilements by Arahant Path Knowledge, and because He possesses great
Buddha power surpassing even the power of Devas and Brahmas. There is no
one in the world equal to Him in virtue and psychic power.</p>
<p>He was worthy to receive respect and homage, offerings and worship
from all world beings including Devas.”</p>
<p>Reflect on Buddha virtues thus. What is shown here are a few Buddha
virtues that can be easily understood - realized. Remembering Buddha
virtues in whatever way one likes is Recollection of the Buddha. Know
that Recollection of the Buddha is not fulfilled by memorizing and
reciting things called Buddha virtues found in books which one does not
understand.</p>

<h2 id="recollection-of-death">8. Recollection of Death</h2>
<p>Reflecting that oneself and all others living in the world will
definitely come to death - that death cannot be escaped by any power -
that death is certain, is Recollection of Death
(<em>Maraṇānussati</em>). Do Recollection of Death as shown below.</p>
<p>“Great warriors who had strength like elephants, great treasurers who
had wealth worth crores, great scholars, great scientists, great kings,
majestic Devas and Brahmas—all fell by the blow of death. How can a
weakling like me escape death? I too will definitely come to death. It
cannot be escaped in any way.</p>
<p>Everyone who is born is born taking death with them. They are born
keeping death in front. Like cattle being led to the slaughterhouse,
everyone travels towards death without stopping. Day by day, death comes
closer, not further.</p>
<p>This life is very weak. It is like a ripe fruit on a tree. Like a
dewdrop. Like a water bubble. Like a lump of foam. There is no moment
death cannot come - no place death cannot come. Some die in the womb
itself. Some die at birth itself. Some die within days of birth. Some
die within weeks. Some die within months. Some die within years. Those
who live long suffer immeasurable decay-suffering. Since Universal
Monarchs with great wealth and majestic Devas and Brahmas also come to
death, it is no wonder that people like me come to death. This death can
come to me even today. Life is uncertain. Death is certain.”</p>

Mindfulness Occupied with the Body or Meditation on Loathsomeness</h2>
<p><strong>Lesson 10</strong></p>
<p>Meditation done taking body parts like hair etc. as object is
Mindfulness Occupied with the Body (<em>Kāyagatāsati</em>) meditation.
It is also called “<strong>Meditation on the Thirty-Two Parts</strong>”
(<em>Dvattiṃsākāra Bhāvanā</em>) and “<strong>Meditation on
Loathsomeness</strong>” (<em>Paṭikkūla Bhāvanā</em>). Many in this
Buddha’s Dispensation have become Arahants through this meditation. This
is also the first meditation subject given to sons of good families
ordaining in the Buddha’s Dispensation.</p>
<p>Hair - Body hair - Nails - Teeth - Skin: Flesh - Sinews - Bones -
Bone marrow - Kidney: Heart - Liver - Pleura - Spleen - Lungs:
Intestines - Mesentery - Undigested food - Feces - Brain: Bile - Phlegm
- Pus - Blood - Sweat - Fat: Tears - Grease - Saliva - Snot - Synovial
fluid - Urine.</p>
<p>There are thirty-two parts in this body. The person doing this
meditation must understand these thirty-two parts well. The color of
every part must be known. The shape must be known. The location must be
known. The direction located must be known. The limits of parts from
top, bottom, and across must be known. This meditation should be done
reciting aloud. Do not take all thirty-two parts and meditate at once.
Divide the thirty-two parts into six groups and recite in forward and
reverse order.</p>
<p>“Hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin; skin, teeth, nails, body hair,
hair” - recite the first group.</p>
<p>“Flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidney; kidney, bone marrow,
bones, sinews, flesh” - recite the second group.</p>
<p>“Heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs; lungs, spleen, pleura, liver,
heart” - recite the third group.</p>
<p>“Intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, brain; brain, feces,
undigested food, mesentery, intestines” - recite the fourth group.</p>
<p>“Bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat; fat, sweat, blood, pus,
phlegm, bile” - recite the fifth group.</p>
<p>“Tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine; urine, synovial
fluid, snot, saliva, grease, tears” - recite the sixth group.</p>
<p>Recite each group for several days, and when the respective parts
start appearing to the mind along with saying the word, recite the next
group. After mastering all well, start reciting all thirty-two parts in
forward and reverse order. Recite all as follows:</p>
<p>“Hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin; flesh, sinews, bones, bone
marrow, kidney; heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs; intestines,
mesentery, undigested food, feces, brain; bile, phlegm, pus, blood,
sweat, fat; tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.</p>
<p>Urine, synovial fluid, snot, saliva, grease, tears; fat, sweat,
blood, pus, phlegm, bile; brain, feces, undigested food, mesentery,
intestines; lungs, spleen, pleura, liver, heart; kidney, bone marrow,
bones, sinews, flesh; skin, teeth, nails, body hair, hair.”</p>
<p>From this meditation, First Jhāna can be obtained. By turning to
Insight, Supramundane Paths and Fruits can also be obtained.</p>

<li>Mindfulness of Breathing - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mindfulness-of-breathing">10. Mindfulness of Breathing</h2>
<p>Establishing the mind on in-breath and out-breath and remembering it
is Mindfulness of Breathing (<em>Ānāpānasati</em>) meditation. This is a
meditation done by many meditators both inside and outside the Buddha’s
Dispensation.</p>
<p>The person doing it should sit and keep the body straight. Then, find
a place where the in-breath and out-breath air touches. For some, that
air touches the tip of the nose and goes out. For some, it touches the
tip of the upper lip and goes out. Centering on the touching place, one
should try to remember seeing the beginning, middle, and end of the
in-breath and out-breath air. The beginning of in-breath is the tip of
the nose. Middle is the chest. End is the navel. Try to see the air
stream traveling from the nose tip to the navel. The beginning of
out-breath air is the navel. Middle is the chest. End is the nose tip.
Do not try to find the air parts that went out of the body.</p>
<p>The person doing this meditation should try to maintain in-breath and
out-breath as they occur naturally. If one tries to breathe in and out
with effort, one might become tired in a short time and reach a state
where meditation cannot be done. Sometimes doing so can also cause
ailments in the stomach and chest. Meditate counting in-breaths and
out-breaths for some time. When counting, do not count continuously, but
count up to ten. When reaching ten, stop counting forward and start
counting from one again. After concentration develops somewhat, stop
counting and remember the air itself seeing everywhere: beginning,
middle, end. If done correctly and well, all five Jhānas are obtained
from this meditation. Even if done to some extent, mindfulness and
wisdom develop from this meditation. Many benefits are obtained.</p>

<p>Meditation on Loving-kindness (Mettā) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="meditation-on-loving-kindness-mettā">Meditation on
Loving-kindness (Mettā)</h3>
<p>Friendliness - non-opposition to others - favorableness - wishing the
welfare of others is Loving-kindness (<em>Mettā</em>). Maintaining the
mind associated with Loving-kindness again and again is Meditation on
Loving-kindness. There are two methods of doing Meditation on
Loving-kindness: doing Meditation on Loving-kindness to obtain Jhāna,
and generally developing Loving-kindness to obtain Meditation Merit. In
whatever way, the virtuous one going to do Meditation on Loving-kindness
should first reflect on the danger of Ill Will or Hatred and the benefit
of Patience.</p>
<p>The dangers of Hatred are many. Hatred is a Dhamma that burns the
mind. It destroys joy. It destroys gentleness and creates a terrifying
face. It defiles virtue. It distracts the mind. It destroys wisdom. It
obstructs practice. It is a path to hell. It creates many sins. It
destroys the path of Dhamma. It destroys virtues. It is a hindrance to
the path to heaven and the path to liberation. It creates various
calamities, various dangers. It is a fear arising from within oneself.
It is an evil. Maintaining hatred is like swallowing burning coals. Like
licking the edge of a razor. Like hugging a snake.</p>
<p>Patience is a root for all virtues. A fertile ground where virtues
grow. Cool water extinguishing the fire of anger. A supreme requisite
for Enlightenment. A mother to wholesome Dhammas. Dispeller of all
suffering. Bringer of all happiness. Calmer of the mind. Doer of both
one’s own welfare and others’ welfare. Thus, the faults of hatred and
the virtues of patience should be considered.</p>
<p>The easy method to obtain Jhāna is to choose one person suitable for
Loving-kindness and do Loving-kindness to that person alone. When
choosing a person, do not take a disliked person, a very dear person, a
neutral person, an enemy, a person of the opposite sex, or a dead
person. Do not take a mother, father, or sibling because they are very
dear. To develop Loving-kindness, one should choose a teacher or someone
like a teacher or another virtuous person who can inspire one’s mind.
There are many words suitable for use in developing Loving-kindness.
However, using a single phrase is better when developing
concentration.</p>
<p>First, one should do Loving-kindness to oneself. However long one
does Loving-kindness to oneself, a Jhāna cannot be obtained from it. The
benefit of doing Loving-kindness to oneself is being able to consider
that just as oneself, others also desire happiness. After doing
Loving-kindness to oneself, considering that just as oneself, others
also desire happiness, considering that happiness is needed for others
as for oneself, considering the virtuous one chosen for developing
Loving-kindness as standing in front of oneself, establishing one’s mind
at the root of the nose between the eyebrows of that person, develop
Loving-kindness again and again saying “May this virtuous one be well.”
By doing so, Loving-kindness Jhāna can be obtained taking that person as
object. The meditator who is not satisfied by developing Loving-kindness
to only one person should develop Loving-kindness towards oneself,
towards those unfriendly to oneself, towards one’s friends, and towards
neutral persons, bringing one’s mind to equality regarding all four
groups. After that, extensive Loving-kindness Jhāna taking many beings
as object can be generated.</p>
<p>Generally, for those doing Meditation on Loving-kindness, it is good
to develop Loving-kindness with various words and in various ways.
Loving-kindness should be developed towards oneself and towards enemies,
friends, and neutrals with various words. When doing so, Loving-kindness
should be developed sincerely with the intention of making others well.
Some think and say “May they be well” without a true desire for others’
wellness. That is not sincere development of Loving-kindness. There is
no power in such development of Loving-kindness.</p>
<p>“May I be free from enmity! May I be free from ill will! May I be
free from suffering! May I live happily!” - thus one should do
Loving-kindness to oneself.</p>
<p>When doing Loving-kindness to other beings, Loving-kindness should be
developed by dividing beings by direction, by race, by plane, etc.</p>
<p>“May all beings living in the East be free from enmity! May they be
free from ill will! May they be free from suffering! May they live
happily! May no one despise another! May no one do harm to another! May
all desire each other’s welfare! May they be endowed with virtues like
faith and morality! May they do no sin! Engaging in wholesome deeds like
giving and virtue, may they see Nibbāna!” - Loving-kindness should be
developed using all these phrases or a few of them. Loving-kindness
should be developed similarly towards beings in other directions.
Develop Loving-kindness applying it as desired by plane, race, region as
well!!</p>

<p>Meditation on Compassion (Karuṇā) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="meditation-on-compassion-karuṇā">Meditation on Compassion
(Karuṇā)</h3>
<p>Just as one does not tolerate suffering arising for oneself, the
nature of not tolerating suffering arising for others too, the nature of
wishing to free suffering ones from suffering, the nature of trembling
about others’ suffering is Compassion. Maintaining Compassion-associated
thoughts again and again is Meditation on Compassion.</p>
<p>The meditator wishing to do it to obtain Jhāna should first find a
supremely suffering person who cannot do any job due to broken limbs or
incurable disease and lives by begging from others, consider his
suffering with wisdom, and maintain Compassion towards him saying “May
this helpless one who has come to great suffering be free from
suffering! Be free!”. Then Compassion should be maintained towards one’s
suffering loved ones, neutrals, and enemies. For those engaging in
meditation establishing equal compassion regarding oneself, one’s
friends, neutrals, and enemies, Compassion Jhāna arises taking suffering
beings as object.</p>
<p>Generally, those doing Meditation on Compassion should consider the
sufferings of respective beings with wisdom and do Meditation on
Compassion saying “May these beings be free from these sufferings!”.
There is no being who cannot be made an object of Compassion. Even
beings considered as happy are not without many sufferings. People who
enjoy five sensual pleasures and rejoice while doing various sins appear
as enjoying happiness, but after death they will come to great
suffering. Considering that fact, Compassion can be maintained towards
them. Treasurers and kings passing time with great wealth also die at
some time and fall from that wealth. Gods rejoicing with sensual
pleasures in delightful mansions and gardens like Nandana surrounded by
thousands of goddesses, and Brahma Kings with aeon-long lifespans
shining like great masses of fire, also fall upon the exhaustion of
merit. Thus considering with wisdom, Compassion should be maintained
towards everyone saying “May these beings be free from suffering”.</p>

<p>Meditation on Appreciative Joy (Muditā) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="meditation-on-appreciative-joy-muditā">Meditation on
Appreciative Joy (Muditā)</h3>
<p>The nature of being happy about happy persons is Meditation on
Appreciative Joy. The meditator wishing to do it to obtain Jhāna should
take a loved person who has pleasant children, good relatives and
friends, beautiful house-vehicle-clothes-ornaments-food-drink, is
healthy, and lives with bodily and mental happiness as object, and do
Meditation on Appreciative Joy saying “This person lives happily without
any deficiency, without any bodily or mental oppression. Oh good! Oh
good!!”. Thus starting from one person, Appreciative Joy should be
gradually expanded. Considering “Because of this person, his wife and
children live happily,” Appreciative Joy should be maintained towards
them. Considering “Because of this person, his relatives, friends,
neighbors live happily,” Appreciative Joy should be maintained towards
them. Thus gradually, Appreciative Joy should be maintained towards
one’s friends, neutrals, and enemies. After reaching a state where
Appreciative Joy can be maintained equally towards everyone,
Appreciative Joy Jhāna can be obtained.</p>
<p>Those wishing to develop Appreciative Joy in the general method
should consider the happiness of beings and maintain Appreciative Joy
saying “These beings live happily. Oh good: Oh good”. There is no being
who cannot be considered as happy. In the Brahma world, majestic Brahma
Kings live very happily for thousands of aeons making joy itself their
food. In celestial worlds like Cātummahārājika, many gods live happily
gratifying senses surrounded by nymphs in extremely beautiful mansions
shining with gems. In the human world, kings, treasurers, and ordinary
wealthy people also live happily eating and drinking well, dressing and
adorning well with their relatives and friends. Poor people also somehow
obtain food and drink they need and rejoice. Beings in Apāya also will
someday be free from that suffering and rejoice. Thus considering the
happiness of respective beings with wisdom, Appreciative Joy can be
developed regarding all.</p>

<p>Meditation on Equanimity (Upekkhā) - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="meditation-on-equanimity-upekkhā">Meditation on Equanimity
(Upekkhā)</h3>
<p>Neutrality maintained regarding beings is Equanimity. Only the Fifth
Jhāna can be obtained from Meditation on Equanimity. The Fifth Jhāna can
be obtained by developing Equanimity only by meditators who have
previously obtained First, Second, Third, Fourth Jhānas from another
meditation.</p>
<p>Those wishing to develop Equanimity should consider the world
situation with wisdom and be neutral regarding beings. The eight Worldly
Conditions (<em>Aṭṭha Loka Dhamma</em>) such as gain and loss come to
all beings. World nature does not change according to one’s wish.
“Everyone is subject to Worldly Dhamma. There is no one capable of
maintaining the world according to his wish. These beings receive
happiness and suffering according to their own kamma. By going the wrong
way, beings come to suffering. By traveling the right way, they come to
happiness. By someone wishing ‘may they be well’, they do not become
well. By wishing ‘may they be free from suffering’, they are not freed
from suffering. Therefore, worrying about the world is a useless
exertion.” Thus considering the world situation, Equanimity should be
developed thinking “These beings receive happiness and suffering
according to their own kamma.”</p>

(<em>Sīla Visuddhi</em>), Purification of Mind (<em>Citta

Purification by Overcoming Doubt (<em>Kaṅkhāvitaraṇa Visuddhi</em>),

(<em>Maggāmaggañāṇadassana Visuddhi</em>), Purification by Knowledge and
Vision of the Way (<em>Paṭipadāñāṇadassana Visuddhi</em>), and
Purification by Knowledge and Vision (<em>Ñāṇadassana
Visuddhi</em>)</strong>.</p>
<!-- Source: 10-13-1.html -->
<p>Purification of Virtue - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="purification-of-virtue">Purification of Virtue</h3>
<p>Pure virtue is Purification of Virtue. Jhānas or Supramundane Paths
and Fruits cannot be obtained by one who is immoral. Immorality is an
obstacle to Jhānas etc. Therefore, the person entering meditation with
the hope of arriving at a certain high state must purify virtue and
start meditation established in pure virtue.</p>
<p>Purification of Virtue should be stated separately for the two
groups: Lay and Ordained. For laypeople, establishing in any virtue
among virtues like Five Precepts etc. is the layperson’s Purification of
Virtue. The Fourfold Purification Virtue: Pātimokkha Restraint Virtue,
Sense Faculty Restraint Virtue, Livelihood Purification Virtue, and
Requisite-Related Virtue is the Purification of Virtue of monks.</p>
<p>The group of precepts laid down by the Buddha for monks is the
<strong>Pātimokkha Restraint Virtue</strong>. It is the main virtue
among mundane virtues.</p>
<p>To those taking signs of objects like forms met by doors like the
eye, many defilements like greed, hatred etc. arise saying “they are
good,” “want to get,” “bad.” To prevent defilements from arising due to
forms etc., one must live constantly mindful. That mindfulness
preventing the arising of defilements is <strong>Sense Faculty Restraint
Virtue</strong>.</p>
<p>Abstaining from improper actions done to maintain life is
<strong>Livelihood Purification Virtue</strong>. That too should be
stated separately according to lay and ordained groups. Abstaining from
misconducts like killing and the five wrong trades regarding living, and
living righteously is the layperson’s Livelihood Purification Virtue.
The layperson’s Livelihood Purification is included in Five Precepts
etc. itself. Abstaining from obtaining requisites by pleasing laypeople
through hypocrisy and giving things etc., and obtaining four requisites
righteously by alms round etc. is the monk’s Livelihood Purification
Virtue.</p>
<p>The Reviewing Knowledge preventing the arising of delusion, craving,
and intoxication in occasions of accepting and using even righteously
received requisites is <strong>Requisite-Related Virtue</strong>. To
protect that virtue, one must reflect on the benefits of food and drink
etc. Or one must reflect on food and drink as repulsive or as elements.
Not doing so is not an obstacle for laypeople to obtain Paths and
Fruits.</p>

<!-- Source: 10-13-2.html -->
<p>Purification of Mind - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="purification-of-mind">Purification of Mind</h3>
<p>The powerful concentration maintaining the mind in the meditation
object itself without allowing hindrances like Sensual Desire defiling
the mind to enter the mind is Purification of Mind. There are two groups
of meditators: <strong>Samathayānika</strong> (Calm Vehicle) and
<strong>Vipassanāyānika</strong> (Insight Vehicle). Meditators who first
do some Calm Meditation and develop Insight establishing on the
concentration obtained from it to obtain Paths and Fruits are
<strong>Samathayānikas</strong>. Meditators who develop Insight itself
without engaging in Calm Meditation are
<strong>Vipassanāyānikas</strong>. Access Concentration and Absorption
Concentration obtained from Calm Meditation are the Purification of Mind
of Samathayānikas. For those doing only Insight, a certain concentration
is obtained from it itself. Because of that concentration, the
meditator’s mind is well established in the meditation object without
going outside. That concentration obtained from Insight itself is the
Purification of Mind of Vipassanāyānikas.</p>
<p>Hindrances like Sensual Desire enter the mind of the person
meditating without concentration from time to time and make it impure.
When there is powerful concentration, the meditation thought stream of
the meditating yogi arises again and again unified in the meditation
object. Thereby the mind remains pure. Since it keeps the meditator’s
mind pure thus, concentration is called Purification of Mind.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 13</strong></p>
<hr />
<!-- Source: 10-13-3.html -->
<p>Purification of View - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="purification-of-view">Purification of View</h3>
<p>The knowledge seeing Name and Matter as they are, dispelling the Self
View, is <strong>Purification of View</strong>. Knowing Name and Matter
separately by way of Characteristic, Function, Manifestation, and
Proximate Cause should also be called Purification of View.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristic (<em>Lakkhaṇa</em>)</strong> is the nature of
the respective Ultimate Reality Dhamma. The body of the Ultimate Reality
Dhamma is also that Characteristic itself.</p>
<p>Each Ultimate Reality Dhamma also has a function performed by it.
Similarly, Ultimate Reality Dhammas also have a power to perform that
respective function. That power is also called ‘Achievement’
(<em>Sampatti</em>). ‘<strong>Function (<em>Rasa</em>)</strong>’ refers
to those two: function and achievement.</p>
<p>There is also a result arising due to the function performed by an
Ultimate Reality Dhamma. That result is called ‘<strong>Manifestation
(<em>Paccupaṭṭhāna</em>)</strong>’. Furthermore, that Ultimate Reality
Dhamma appears to the mind of the meditator investigating Ultimate
Reality Dhammas in a certain way. That appearing mode is also called
‘Manifestation’.</p>
<p>The main and apparent cause for the arising of the respective
Ultimate Reality Dhamma is called ‘<strong>Proximate Cause
(<em>Padaṭṭhāna</em>)</strong>’. It is also called ‘Near Cause’.</p>
<p>Of these four facts, Characteristic should be known like the heat
nature in fire. Function should be known like the burning nature in
fire. Manifestation should be known like the nature producing smoke in
fire. Proximate Cause should be known like the firewood producing fire.
The characteristic of fire is heat nature. Function is burning nature or
cooking nature. The manifestation of fire is emitting smoke. Proximate
Cause is firewood.</p>
<p>Of the four facts Characteristic etc., the main matter is the
Characteristic. When it is known, that respective Ultimate Reality
Dhamma is known. When Function, Manifestation, and Proximate Cause are
also known, that respective Ultimate Reality Dhamma is known very well.
Therefore, in Commentaries, when introducing Ultimate Reality Dhammas,
the four facts Characteristic etc. of every Formation are shown.</p>
<p>Of the seven Purifications, the two Purifications of Virtue and Mind
are the ground of Insight. The five Purifications starting with
Purification of View are the body of Insight. The meditator who has
developed the two Root Purifications should next try to recognize Name
and Matter to develop Purification of View. It should be done by
meditation itself. Samathayānikas should start discerning Name and
Matter based on the Jhāna they have obtained. The Vipassanāyānika should
find the Matter group first based on parts like hair etc., and then find
the Name group. Discerning Name and Matter is done by some meditators by
the brief method, and by some meditators by the detailed method.</p>
<p>The meditator doing by the brief method: Examining the internal group
of Dhammas considered as I, being, person, sees the group of Dhammas
having the characteristic of bending, and separates this group of
Dhammas in the mind as Name. Seeing the group of Dhammas having the
characteristic of deforming, he separates this group of Dhammas in the
mind as Matter. He knows that Name is Name itself and not Matter, Matter
is Matter itself and not Name, Name is Name and not a being - not I,
Matter is Matter itself and not a being - not I, and apart from the Name
and Matter two groups which are not being or person, there is no I who
does merit and demerit and experiences happiness and suffering, nor a
human, nor a god, nor anyone else among this Name and Matter group.
Knowing Name and Matter well thus is discerning Name and Matter by the
brief method.</p>
<p>In the internal group of Dhammas considered as I, what is called Name
is the Citta and Cetasika group. They arise in the bases: Eye, Ear,
Nose, Tongue, Body, Heart. All those Dhammas arising in bases arise
taking some object like Form, Sound etc. They arise turning towards the
object, looking at the object. Bending means the nature of being
inclined towards the object. The bending characteristic refers to that
nature. That nature of dragging, bending towards the object does not
exist in Rūpas which are places for the arising of Name Dhammas.
Therefore, they are not Name. They undergo deformation due to cold, heat
etc. Deforming means coming to that alteration. Being deformed by cold,
heat etc. is the characteristic of Rūpa.</p>
<p>The person with excessive wisdom is capable of eliminating Identity
View (<em>Sakkāya Diṭṭhi</em>) along with Perversion of Perception,
Consciousness, and View by discerning Name and Matter briefly itself.
Taking Name and Form Dhammas which are not Self as Self is
<strong>Perversion of View (<em>Diṭṭhi Vipallāsa</em>)</strong>.
Perversion of View is also suppressed by faith in the Buddha and
accepting the Dhamma. The abandoning of Perversion of Perception and
Consciousness occurs only by discerning Name and Matter, not by any
other method. Until knowledge of Name and Matter becomes pure,
Perversion of Perception and Consciousness are not abandoned. As long as
those two exist, knowledge of Name and Matter has not become pure.</p>
<p>The person discerning Name and Matter in detail discerns Name and
Matter by methods like Aggregates, Elements, Bases etc. Understanding of
Name and Form Dhammas should be developed until the Perversions of
Perception, Consciousness, and View that there is a Self are
eliminated.</p>
<p>To the meditator who has known Name and Matter well, seeing that
there is nothing other than Name and Matter, the view “There is a Self
inside the body engaging Name and Matter in respective works; that Self
performs all actions, experiences happiness and suffering, goes from
birth to birth” is eliminated. Seeing that neither Name nor Matter can
perform any action individually, the view taking Name itself or Matter
itself or both as Self is eliminated.</p>

<p>Purification by Overcoming Doubt - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="purification-by-overcoming-doubt">Purification by Overcoming
Doubt</h3>
<p>The knowledge knowing the causes of arising of Name and Matter,
dispelling doubts such as “How did these Name and Matter arise? Did
these exist like this in the past too? Will they arise in the future
too?”, is <strong>Purification by Overcoming Doubt</strong>.</p>
<p>The meditator who has developed Purification of View by finding the
nature of Name and Matter should now search for the conditions of Name
and Matter to develop Purification by Overcoming Doubt. It can be done
briefly or in detail. Considering that Name arises due to Eye etc. bases
and Form etc. objects, and Matter arises due to Citta, Season,
Nutriment; and that both Name and Matter parts arise due to Ignorance,
Craving, Clinging, Kamma—this is briefly considering the conditions of
Name and Matter. The Dependent Origination method shown in the Eighth
Chapter here is the detailed method of considering conditions. Beginners
should not go to search for conditions by the Conditional Relations
(<em>Paṭṭhāna</em>) method. It is beyond their scope.</p>
<p>To the meditator examining the conditions of Name and Matter, seeing
that the group of Name and Form Dhammas arises completely from
conditions, the No-Cause View (<em>Ahetuka Diṭṭhi</em>) is abandoned.
Seeing that those Name and Form Dhammas arise only from causes suitable
for the arising of those respective Name and Form Dhammas and not in any
other way, the Wrong Cause View (<em>Visama Hetu Diṭṭhi</em>) that these
Name and Matter are created by God, created by Time, etc., is also
abandoned. The view that there is a doer of kamma and experiencer of
result other than Name and Matter is also abandoned. Seeing the arising
of Name and Matter as cause and effect lineage in endless Saṃsāra,
doubts such as “Did I exist in the past? Will I exist in the future?”
are eliminated. Seeing the truth of the Buddha’s preaching, doubt
arising in eight places like Buddha etc. is eliminated.</p>

<p>When proceeding with Insight Meditation, due to the appearing of
imperfections like Aura (<em>Obhāsa</em>) etc., places where the path
can be missed arise for the meditator. In those occasions, the knowledge
knowing without error “This is the true path, this is the non-path” is
Purification by Knowledge and Vision of What is and is Not the Path.</p>
<p>The meditator who has developed Purification by Overcoming Doubt by
discerning Name and Matter with conditions should next do the Meditation
on the Three Characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>The Three Characteristics</strong></p>
<p>There are three characteristics of Formations: Impermanence
Characteristic, Suffering Characteristic, Non-Self Characteristic.</p>
<p>The nature of not remaining permanently after arising—the breaking
up—is the <strong>Impermanence Characteristic</strong> of Formations.
Since they possess the Impermanence Characteristic, Formations are
Impermanent.</p>
<p>For the one who has taken a group of Formations which are not
permanent and definitely break as “I” and attached to them as “mine,”
much exhaustion occurs regarding protecting those Formations and
regarding creating new Formations to replace the breaking ones. A
constant fear also arises in him about the breaking of Formations. The
nature of Formations causing fear and exhaustion is the
<strong>Suffering Characteristic</strong> of Formations. Since they
possess the Suffering Characteristic, Formations are Suffering.</p>
<p>If considered as a Self, a stable core thing should be considered. In
Formations that decay and break again and again, that stable core nature
does not exist. What exists in them is a nature opposed to stable core
nature. The absence of stable core nature is the <strong>Non-Self
Characteristic</strong> of Formations. Since they possess the Non-Self
Characteristic, Formations are Non-Self.</p>
<p><strong>Three Contemplations</strong></p>
<p>“Contemplation of Impermanence (<em>Aniccānupassanā</em>) -
Contemplation of Suffering (<em>Dukkhānupassanā</em>) - Contemplation of
Non-Self (<em>Anattānupassanā</em>)” are three Contemplations.
<em>Anupassanā</em> means meditation/contemplation.</p>
<p>Looking with wisdom thinking again and again Name and Matter and
their impermanence as “Form is impermanent, Feeling is impermanent” etc.
is <strong>Contemplation of Impermanence</strong>. Stated another way,
it is Impermanence Meditation.</p>
<p>Looking with wisdom thinking again and again Name and Matter and
their suffering characteristic as “Form is suffering, Feeling is
suffering” etc. is <strong>Contemplation of Suffering</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking with wisdom thinking again and again Name and Matter and
their non-self characteristic as “Form is non-self, Feeling is non-self”
is <strong>Contemplation of Non-Self</strong>.</p>
<p>The meditator who has developed Purification by Overcoming Doubt
should next engage in meditation by remembering - looking at Formations
as Impermanent etc. again and again. Stated another way, doing the
Meditation on the Three Characteristics. In doing so, if one goes to
look at the impermanent etc. characteristics of Formations by taking
them one by one, it is a task that cannot be finished, so it should not
be done so. Even if one thinks of the impermanence etc. of all
Formations by taking them all at once with the mind, since Formations
are very many, a clear understanding cannot be developed. Therefore, the
meditator observing Formations with insight should take respective
Formations as groups by methods like Aggregates, and observe with
insight in various ways as “Form is impermanent - Feeling is
impermanent” etc. After the three characteristics Impermanence etc. of
Formations are well understood, one should start looking at the arising
and breaking of those Name and Matter. It should be done according to
causes as “when these causes exist these Dhammas come to be, when causes
do not exist they cease.” Looking at the arising and ceasing of Name and
Matter without expecting causes should also be done. The arising of
Formations is called ‘<strong>Rise</strong>’ (<em>Udaya</em>) and the
breaking is called ‘<strong>Fall</strong>’ (<em>Vaya</em>). While the
meditator is looking at the arising and breaking of Formations, when the
Knowledge of Rise and Fall becomes developed and sharp, Imperfections of
Insight appear.</p>

<p>The Ten Imperfections of Insight - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="the-ten-imperfections-of-insight">The Ten Imperfections of
Insight</h3>
<p><strong>Aura (<em>Obhāsa</em>), Joy (<em>Pīti</em>), Tranquillity
(<em>Passaddhi</em>), Decision (<em>Adhimokkha</em>), Exertion
(<em>Paggaha</em>), Happiness (<em>Sukha</em>), Knowledge
(<em>Ñāṇa</em>), Mindfulness (<em>Upaṭṭhāna</em>), Equanimity
(<em>Upekkhā</em>), Attachment (<em>Nikanti</em>)</strong>—these ten are
Imperfections of Insight (<em>Vipassanūpakkilesa</em>). Imperfections of
Insight are a group of factors that mislead the meditator and are
obstacles to Insight. They do not arise for meditators who have not done
Insight well. Their arising is a sign that Insight has been done well up
to then.</p>
<p><strong>Aura</strong> is a special light visible only to the
meditator - not visible to others, arising solely by the power of
Insight. It arises for some meditators as if only their body is visible,
for some as if the room they are in is visible everywhere, for some as
if visible for leagues - yojanas distance.</p>
<p><strong>Joy</strong> is the powerful joy arising because the
Knowledge of Insight is good, because the Rise and Fall of Formations is
seen very well.</p>
<p><strong>Tranquillity</strong> is the calming of body and mind arising
from Insight. Because of that calming, the meditator can engage in
meditation as long as desired without any difficulty. Even the passing
of time is not felt.</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong> is powerful Faith. At this time, a powerful
faith that pleases the mind extremely arises in the meditator with the
Insight Consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Exertion</strong> is Energy. At this time, a good energy that
is neither too lax nor too rapid arises in the meditator with the
Insight Consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Happiness</strong> is a powerful happiness spreading through
the whole body and pleasing the whole body, arising with the Insight
Consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge</strong> is the very sharp Insight Knowledge
penetrating Form and Formless Dhammas.</p>
<p><strong>Mindfulness</strong> is the Mindfulness Cetasika associated
with Insight Consciousness. At this time, a powerful mindfulness
established in the Formations being observed with insight arises in the
meditator, with his mind unshaken like a rock.</p>
<p><strong>Equanimity</strong> is the two Equanimities: Neutrality of
Mind (<em>Tatramajjhattatā</em>) and Adverting Equanimity.</p>
<p><strong>Attachment</strong> is the subtle craving attached to the
Insight adorned with Aura etc. It is a very subtle greed difficult to
know as a defilement. The true Imperfection of Insight is that
Attachment. Aura etc. become imperfections because they are causes for
Attachment.</p>
<p>When Aura etc. appear, the unskilled meditator gives up meditation
thinking “I never had such light - such joy - such wisdom before. Now
these wonderful things arise for me because I have reached the Path and
Fruit,” claiming “I am a Stream-Enterer” without being a Stream-Enterer
or “I am an Arahant” without being an Arahant. The skilled meditator,
understanding that a subtle craving arises regarding Aura etc., and
understanding that if it grows he will fall from the Path to Nibbāna and
fall back to the path of Saṃsāra, to dispel that craving, contemplates
“This light is an impermanent Dhamma, suffering because it causes fear,
non-self because it is coreless” etc., and dispels the craving arising
regarding Aura etc. The knowledge of the meditator who has dispelled
craving by considering the Dhammas obstructive to Insight like Aura etc.
as impermanent etc. thus, understanding the characteristics of the Path
and Not-Path, is <strong>Purification by Knowledge and Vision of What is
and is Not the Path</strong>.</p>

<p>Purification by Knowledge and Vision of the Way - Abhidhamma
Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="purification-by-knowledge-and-vision-of-the-way">Purification by
Knowledge and Vision of the Way</h3>
<p>There are ten Insight Knowledges: Knowledge of Comprehension,
Knowledge of Rise and Fall, Knowledge of Dissolution, Knowledge of
Fearfulness, Knowledge of Danger, Knowledge of Disenchantment, Knowledge
of Desire for Deliverance, Knowledge of Reflective Contemplation,
Knowledge of Equanimity towards Formations, and Knowledge of
Conformity.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge of Comprehension (<em>Sammasana
Ñāṇa</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The knowledge knowing the three characteristics Impermanence etc. of
Name and Form Dhammas is Knowledge of Comprehension. It has already been
obtained by the meditator who has developed Purification by Knowledge
and Vision of What is and is Not the Path. He has to meditate to develop
the nine knowledges starting with Knowledge of Rise and Fall in the
future. The nine Insight Knowledges from Knowledge of Rise and Fall to
Knowledge of Conformity arising in future meditation for the person who
has developed Purification by Knowledge and Vision of What is and is Not
the Path is <strong>Purification by Knowledge and Vision of the
Way</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge of Rise and Fall (<em>Udayabbaya
Ñāṇa</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The Insight Knowledge seeing how new Formations arise that did not
exist before, and how all arisen Formations break up, is named
‘Knowledge of Rise and Fall’.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge of Dissolution (<em>Bhaṅgānudassana
Ñāṇa</em>)</strong></p>
<p>As the meditator’s knowledge becomes developed and sharp by observing
the arising and breaking of Formations caught by his mind, very quickly
many Formations start appearing to his mind, and he has no time to
remember the arising and breaking of all of them. After that, the
meditator stops contemplating the arising of Formations that appear and
starts looking only at their dissolution (<em>bhaṅga</em>). Just as
water bubbles are seen breaking up when looking at a water body during
rain, the breaking up of Formations in his own continuity starts
appearing to his wisdom. That knowledge seeing the breaking of
Formations is called ‘Knowledge of Dissolution’.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge of Fearfulness (<em>Bhayatupaṭṭhāna
Ñāṇa</em>)</strong></p>
<p>To the meditator seeing Formations breaking up everywhere in the
three existences: Sense, Fine-Material, and Immaterial like mustard
seeds popping in a pan, the group of breaking Formations starts
appearing as something to be feared. That Insight Knowledge seeing
Formations as fearful is called ‘Knowledge of Fearfulness’.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge of Danger (<em>Ādīnavānudassana
Ñāṇa</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The breaking of Formations cannot be stopped by anyone by any means.
They have no refuge. They are helpless. That Insight Knowledge seeing
that helplessness of Formations is ‘Knowledge of Danger’.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge of Disenchantment (<em>Nibbidānudassana
Ñāṇa</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Seeing that the group of Formation Dhammas, which the meditator loved
as “I” and “mine” in the past, is helpless, the meditator develops
disenchantment regarding them. The heap of Formations becomes repulsive
to the meditator. The Insight Knowledge associated with the nature of
disenchantment towards Formations is called ‘Knowledge of
Disenchantment’.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge of Desire for Deliverance (<em>Muñcitukamyatā
Ñāṇa</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The Insight Knowledge accompanied by the idea of being delivered from
those disenchanted Formations is called ‘Knowledge of Desire for
Deliverance’.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge of Reflective Contemplation
(<em>Paṭisaṅkhānupassanā Ñāṇa</em>)</strong></p>
<p>The extensive Insight Knowledge of the meditator who wishes to be
delivered from Formations, observing Formations in manifold ways in
detail as a strategy to escape from them, is called “Knowledge of
Reflective Contemplation”.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge of Equanimity towards Formations
(<em>Saṅkhārupekkhā Ñāṇa</em>)</strong></p>
<p>Seeing the great mass of dangers of Formations by Knowledge of
Reflective Contemplation, thinking ‘I have obtained the strategy to
escape from suffering’, giving up the strong effort to investigate
Formations, the Insight Knowledge maintained with even effort is
‘Knowledge of Equanimity towards Formations’. Although devoid of the
effort of investigating Formations, this knowledge is more powerful than
all previous knowledges. Just as a stone thrown into the sky falls
towards the earth effortlessly and very fast when released, this
knowledge also exists very fast in the characteristics Impermanence etc.
of Formations automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge of Conformity (<em>Anuloma Ñāṇa</em>)</strong></p>
<p>When Knowledge of Equanimity towards Formations develops and it is
very close to the arising of Supramundane Path Knowledge, the Insight
Knowledge existing in conformity with the eight Insight Knowledges
starting with Knowledge of Rise and Fall and with the Supramundane Path
Knowledge is called ‘Knowledge of Conformity’.</p>

<p>Purification by Knowledge and Vision - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</p>
<h3 id="purification-by-knowledge-and-vision">Purification by Knowledge
and Vision</h3>
<p>To the meditator engaging in meditation as stated, when Insight
Knowledge develops and becomes very close to the arising of the
Supramundane Path Consciousness called Absorption (<em>Appanā</em>),
cutting off the stream of Bhavanga Consciousness, after the Mind-door
Adverting Consciousness arisen, two or three Insight Cittas arise and
cease under the names <strong>Preparation (<em>Parikamma</em>), Access
(<em>Upacāra</em>), Conformity (<em>Anuloma</em>)</strong> taking one of
the three characteristics Impermanence etc. as object. <em>Vuṭṭhāna</em>
(Emergence) is also a name used for the Supramundane Path Consciousness.
The Supramundane Path Consciousness is called <strong>Emergence</strong>
because it rises from the sign of Formations which was the object of
Insight, and from the nature of being a base for Fetters. Since it
raises the person in whom it arises from the state of Worldling and from
Saṃsāra, the Path Consciousness is called Emergence. After the Insight
Cittas arising by the names Preparation, Access, Conformity, a certain
Citta among Knowledge-Associated Sense-Sphere Wholesome arises by the
name <strong>Change-of-lineage (<em>Gotrabhū</em>)</strong> taking
Nibbāna as object, destroying the Worldling state of the meditator and
bringing him to the Noble state. After that, the <strong>Stream-Entry
Path Consciousness</strong> associated with the Supramundane Eightfold
Path arises once with the Javana function, fully understanding the Truth
of Suffering, abandoning the Truth of Origin, realizing the Truth of
Cessation by taking it as object. Following that, after the Stream-Entry
Fruit Consciousness arises twice or thrice, Bhavanga descent occurs. By
this happening, the meditator transcends the state of Worldling and
becomes the Noble Person called Stream-Enterer.</p>
<p>Then that Stream-Enterer reviews the Path he arrived at, the Fruit
obtained from it, the defilements abandoned by him, the remaining
defilements, and Nibbāna. All Noble Ones review thus. Since the Arahant
person has no remaining defilements, he reviews only the other four
facts.</p>
<p>When the Stream-Enterer wishes to arrive at the Once-Returning Path
and Fruit, he observes Formations with insight as before. As stated
above, when Knowledge of Equanimity towards Formations becomes sharp, at
an occasion, Conformity and Change-of-lineage knowledges arise, and
Once-Returning Path Consciousness and Fruit Consciousness arise.
Non-Returning and Arahant Paths and Fruits also arise in that same
method.</p>
<p>To the four Supramundane Paths arising thus, <strong>Purification by
Knowledge and Vision</strong> is said.</p>
<p>(Although the <strong>Division of Emancipations</strong> is shown
here in many books, since there is not much benefit from it for ordinary
people, it is not shown here. See Chapter 6 of the book
<strong>Vidarshanā Bhāvanā Kramaya</strong>.)</p>

<h2 id="noble-individuals">14. Noble Individuals</h2>
<p><strong>Lesson 17</strong></p>
<p>Individuals who have done Insight Meditation and generated
Supramundane Paths and Fruits are Noble Individuals (<em>Ariya
Puggala</em>). Others are Worldlings (<em>Puthujjana</em>).</p>
<p>Stream-Entry Path-stander, Stream-Entry Fruit-stander, Once-Returning
Path-stander, Once-Returning Fruit-stander, Non-Returning Path-stander,
Non-Returning Fruit-stander, Arahant Path-stander, Arahant
Fruit-stander—there are eight Noble Individuals. There are four
Path-standers. There are four Fruit-standers. One individual exists as a
Path-stander only during the moment the Supramundane Path Consciousness
exists in his continuity. That is a very short time. Therefore, a
Path-stander cannot be found. As soon as the Path Consciousness ceases,
the Fruit Consciousness arises, so the Path-stander becomes a
Fruit-stander. Since the Path-standing state is momentary, the names
Stream-Enterer, Once-Returner, Non-Returner, Arahant are mostly used for
Fruit-standing individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Abandoning of Defilements</strong></p>
<p>The two defilements: View (<em>Diṭṭhi</em>) and Doubt
(<em>Vicikicchā</em>) are completely abandoned by the
<strong>Stream-Entry Path</strong>. Other defilements gross enough to
cause birth in Apāya are also abandoned.</p>
<p>Speaking by way of Cittas: The four View-Associated Cittas and the
Doubt-Associated Citta—these five Cittas are completely abandoned by the
Stream-Entry Path. The four View-Dissociated Cittas and two
Hatred-Rooted Cittas arising gross enough to cause birth in Apāya are
also abandoned.</p>
<p>The four View-Dissociated Cittas, two Hatred-Rooted Cittas, and
Restlessness-Associated Citta which are not gross enough to cause birth
in Apāya remain for the Stream-Enterer.</p>
<p>By the <strong>Once-Returning Path</strong>, gross Greed, Hatred, and
Delusion are abandoned. Those defilements arise in the Once-Returning
person only rarely. Even when they arise rarely, they do not arise
grossly.</p>
<p>Speaking by way of Cittas: The gross View-Dissociated four Cittas and
two Hatred-Rooted Cittas are abandoned by the Once-Returning Path.
Subtle View-Dissociated four Cittas, two Hatred-Rooted Cittas, and
Restlessness-Associated Citta remain for the Once-Returning person.</p>
<p>By the <strong>Non-Returning Path</strong>, Sensual Lust and Ill Will
are completely abandoned. Speaking by way of Cittas: The four
View-Dissociated Cittas with Sensual Lust and the two Hatred-Rooted
Cittas are completely abandoned by the Non-Returning Path.</p>
<p>The four View-Dissociated Cittas with Fine-material Lust and
Immaterial Lust, and the Restlessness-Associated Citta remain for the
Non-Returning person.</p>
<p>Fine-material Lust, Immaterial Lust, Conceit, Restlessness, and
Ignorance—these are completely abandoned by the Arahant Path.</p>
<p>Speaking by way of Cittas: The four subtle View-Dissociated Cittas
with Fine-material Lust, Immaterial Lust, Conceit, and the
Restlessness-Associated Citta are also abandoned by the Arahant Path.
There are no remaining defilements for the Arahant person.</p>
<p><strong>Attainments (<em>Samāpatti</em>)</strong></p>
<p>There are three types of Attainments: “Jhāna Attainment, Fruit
Attainment, Cessation Attainment.”</p>
<p>Living with any Fine-material-sphere or Immaterial-sphere Jhāna
Consciousness is called “<strong>Jhāna Attainment</strong>.” In the
occasion of first obtaining Jhāna, for the person meditating for it,
after Sense-Sphere Javana Consciousnesses arise and cease three or four
times by names Preparation - Access - Conformity - Change-of-lineage,
Jhāna Consciousness arises once and becomes Bhavanga. The person
generating Jhāna for the first time is called “Beginner”
(<em>Ādikammika</em>). If the person who obtained Jhāna once meditates
again to generate that Jhāna Consciousness, after Sense-Sphere Javana
arises and ceases three or four times as before, Jhāna Consciousness
arises many times. According to the development of the meditator’s
concentration, without becoming Bhavanga, the Jhāna Consciousness arises
continuously thousands, lakhs of times. He can live like that even for
hours. That is <strong>Jhāna Attainment</strong>.</p>
<p>Living with Supramundane Fruit Consciousness is <strong>Fruit
Attainment</strong>. If the person who obtained a Supramundane Fruit
once meditates again to generate it, just like Jhāna Cittas, Fruit
Cittas arise continuously thousands, lakhs of times for him too without
becoming Bhavanga.</p>
<p>Living stopping the arising of Cittas completely is <strong>Cessation
Attainment</strong>. Only Non-Returners and Arahants who have obtained
the Eight Attainments can enter Cessation Attainment. They enter
Cessation Attainment desiring to obtain the bliss of Nibbāna in the
present existence itself. Non-Returners and Arahants of the Immaterial
existence cannot do it.</p>
<p>When the Eight-Attainment Non-Returner or Arahant person wishes to
enter Cessation Attainment, sitting in a quiet place, first entering the
First Jhāna, rising from it, he observes the formations belonging to
that First Jhāna as impermanent, suffering, and non-self with insight.
Then entering Second Jhāna, rising from it, observes formations
belonging to it with insight as impermanent etc. Then entering Third
Jhāna, rising from it, observes formations belonging to it with insight
as impermanent etc. Thus doing up to Ākiñcaññāyatana Jhāna, entering
Viññāṇañcāyatana Jhāna, rising from it, performing the four Preliminary
Duties: <strong>Non-destruction of others’ belongings, Waiting for
Sangha’s call, Summoning by the Teacher, Limitation of
duration</strong>, enters Nevasaññānāsaññāyatana Jhāna. After the
Nevasaññānāsaññāyatana Consciousness arises once or twice, the arising
of Cittas in that person stops. That is <strong>Cessation
Attainment</strong>. After the time resolved to live in Cessation
passes, if the person entered is a Non-Returning person, Non-Returning
Fruit Citta arises once, and if an Arahant person, Arahant Fruit Citta
arises once, and then Bhavanga descent occurs. After that, Cittas start
arising as usual.</p>
<p>Of the four Preliminary Duties, <strong>Non-destruction of others’
belongings</strong> is resolving “If there is any requisite not
connected to my body, may they not be destroyed during the time I am in
Cessation Attainment.” No harm comes from fire, water etc. to the body
of the person entered in Cessation Attainment or to items bound with the
body during the time of Cessation Attainment. It is the power of the
attainment itself. Since requisites not bound with the body are not
protected so, one must make a resolution about them.</p>
<p><strong>Waiting for Sangha’s call</strong> is resolving “If I am
needed by the Sangha for a Vinaya act, may rising from the attainment
happen immediately!”. <strong>Summoning by the Teacher</strong> is
resolving “If the Buddha needs to meet me, may rising from the
attainment happen immediately!”.</p>
<p><strong>Limitation of duration</strong> is “considering one’s
lifespan.” If death is to happen during the time of Cessation
Attainment, one has to rise from the attainment. Therefore, the time
life lasts should be looked at.</p>

Cognitive Processes (Appanā Vīthi)</h2>
<p><strong>Lesson 18</strong></p>
<p>Processes that are Sublime (<em>Mahaggata</em>) and Supramundane
Javanas are “<strong>Absorption Processes</strong>.” Absorption
Processes are of five parts: Jhāna Process, Path Process, Fruit
Attainment Process, Direct Knowledge Process, and Cessation Attainment
Process.</p>
<p>There are nine Jhāna Processes: First Jhāna Process, Second Jhāna
Process, Third Jhāna Process, Fourth Jhāna Process, Fifth Jhāna Process,
Ākāsānañcāyatana Jhāna Process, Viññāṇañcāyatana Jhāna Process,
Ākiñcaññāyatana Jhāna Process, and Nevasaññānāsaññāyatana Jhāna Process.
Since each process becomes two as Beginner Process and Attainment
Process, there are eighteen Jhāna Processes.</p>
<p>Jhāna Paths and Fruits can be obtained only by persons who received
wisdom from birth by receiving a Knowledge-Associated Rebirth-Linking.
Persons with little wisdom cannot obtain Jhāna etc. Wise persons are
also of two parts: “Those with sharp wisdom and those with dull wisdom.”
In this Dhamma, the name <strong>Khippābhiñña</strong> is used for those
with sharp wisdom, and <strong>Dandhābhiñña</strong> for those with dull
wisdom (non-sharp wisdom).</p>
<p>Of the aforementioned eighteen Jhāna Processes, since each process
becomes two by way of Dandhābhiñña and Khippābhiñña persons, there are
thirty-six Jhāna Processes. Of those, since each process becomes two by
way of Wholesome Jhāna and Functional Jhāna, there are seventy-two Jhāna
Processes.</p>
<p><strong>The Two First Jhāna Beginner Processes</strong></p>
<p>When the meditator engaging in meditation suitable to obtain the
First Jhāna is close to obtaining Jhāna, after Vibrating Bhavanga and
Arrest Bhavanga, the Mind-door Adverting Consciousness arises taking the
meditation object as object and ceases. Then, taking that same object,
any one of the Knowledge-Associated Sense-Sphere Javanas arises and
ceases four times by names Preparation (<em>Parikamma</em>) - Access
(<em>Upacāra</em>) - Conformity (<em>Anuloma</em>) - Change-of-lineage
(<em>Gotrabhū</em>), and then the First Jhāna Consciousness arises once
and ceases. After that, Bhavanga occurs. This is the <strong>First Jhāna
Beginner Process of the Dandhābhiñña person</strong>.</p>
<p>For the Khippābhiñña person, after Vibrating Bhavanga and Arrest
Bhavanga, taking the meditation object as object, Mind-door Adverting
and Sense-Sphere Javana arise three times as Access - Conformity -
Change-of-lineage, and then First Jhāna Consciousness arises once and
becomes Bhavanga. This is the <strong>First Jhāna Beginner Process of
the Khippābhiñña person</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>First Jhāna Attainment Processes</strong></p>
<p>When the meditator who obtained the First Jhāna thus wishes to enter
the Jhāna again at some time and engages in that meditation, after
Vibrating Bhavanga - Arrest Bhavanga - Mind-door Adverting - Preparation
- Access - Conformity - Change-of-lineage Cittas arise and cease in
order, the First Jhāna Javana Consciousness arises many times and then
becomes Bhavanga. This is the <strong>First Jhāna Attainment Process of
the Dandhābhiñña person</strong>. When this process arises for the
Khippābhiñña person, the “Preparation Consciousness” does not arise.
Only three Sense-Sphere Javanas arise as Access - Conformity -
Change-of-lineage. That is the only difference.</p>
<p><strong>Dandhābhiñña’s First Jhāna Beginner Process</strong></p>
<p>Bhavanga Calana, Bhavangupaccheda, Manodvārāvajjana, Parikamma,
Upacāra, Anuloma, Gotrabhū, First Jhāna, Bhavanga.</p>
<p><strong>Khippābhiñña’s Beginner Process</strong></p>
<p>Bhavanga Calana, Bhavangupaccheda, Manodvārāvajjana, Upacāra,
Anuloma, Gotrabhū, First Jhāna, Bhavanga.</p>
<p>The difference in the two Attainment Processes is only the arising of
Jhāna Consciousness many times. The order of Cittas in Second Jhāna
Processes etc. is also the same. The difference is only the arising of
the respective Jhāna Consciousness in each process.</p>
<p>The name <strong>Preparation (<em>Parikamma</em>)</strong> is given
to the first Citta of the Sense-Sphere Javanas arising in these
processes because that Citta exists as if preparing Absorption by being
especially helpful for the arising of Absorption Consciousness through
faculty balance etc. The name <strong>Access (<em>Upacāra</em>)</strong>
is given to the second Citta because it exists close to Absorption by
being helpful for the arising of Absorption Consciousness in the
immediate future. The meaning of the word <em>Upacāra</em> is the Citta
moving near. The name <strong>Conformity (<em>Anuloma</em>)</strong> is
given to the third Citta because it exists conforming to Absorption by
removing obstacles to the arising of Absorption Consciousness like
Sensual Desire etc. The name <strong>Change-of-lineage
(<em>Gotrabhū</em>)</strong> is given to the fourth Citta because it
transcends the Sense-Sphere state, and no Sense-Sphere Citta arises
after that Citta but an Absorption Consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Reviewing Processes (<em>Paccavekkhana
Vīthi</em>)</strong></p>
<p>After obtaining Jhāna and after rising from Jhāna Attainment, Jhāna
attainers review the Jhāna factors in the Jhāna they obtained or
entered. They do so to generate Adverting Mastery and Reviewing Mastery.
Reviewing Processes arise equal to the number of Jhāna factors in
respective Jhānas. Since there are five Jhāna factors in the First
Jhāna, five processes arise: Process reviewing Vitakka, Process
reviewing Vicāra, Process reviewing Pīti, Process reviewing Sukha,
Process reviewing Ekaggatā. In Reviewing Processes, only Sense-Sphere
Javanas arise. The Reviewing Process becomes Bhavanga after Vibrating
Bhavanga, Arrest Bhavanga, Mind-door Adverting Consciousness taking the
Jhāna factor as object, and any Sense-Sphere Javana seven times.</p>
<p>For those with Mastery, in occasions of reviewing Jhāna factors
quickly for performing psychic powers etc., the process ends with five
or four Sense-Sphere Javanas.</p>

<h2 id="path-processes-and-fruition-attainment-processes">16. Path
Processes and Fruition Attainment Processes</h2>
<p><strong>Lesson 19</strong></p>
<p>There are four Path Processes: <strong>Stream-Entry Path Process,
Once-Returning Path Process, Non-Returning Path Process, and Arahant
Path Process</strong>. Since there are five Stream-Entry Path Cittas
each by the method of Jhāna as “First Jhāna Stream-Entry Path” etc.,
there are five Stream-Entry Path Processes. Since the remaining Path
Processes are also five each similarly, there are twenty Path Processes.
By each process becoming twofold as Dull-witted (<em>Mandapañña</em>)
and Sharp-witted (<em>Tīkṣhṇa Pañña</em>), there are forty Path
Processes.</p>
<p>The First Jhāna Stream-Entry Path Process is as follows: When the
Supramundane Path is close to arising for the meditator observing
Formations with insight as impermanent etc., after Vibrating Bhavanga
and Arrest Bhavanga, the Mind-door Adverting Consciousness arises taking
some Formation as object and ceases. Following that, a
Knowledge-Associated Sense-Sphere Wholesome Citta arises and ceases by
way of observing that same Formation as impermanent, suffering, or
non-self, by the names Preparation - Access - Conformity. Following
that, that same Sense-Sphere Wholesome Javana arises and ceases by the
name Change-of-lineage (<em>Gotrabhū</em>) taking Nibbāna as object.
Following that, realizing Nibbāna, the Stream-Entry Path Consciousness
arises once and the Stream-Entry Fruit Consciousness arises twice, and
then Bhavanga occurs. This is the Stream-Entry Path Process of the
Dull-witted person.</p>
<p>For the Sharp-witted person, Preparation Consciousness does not
arise. For him, after Sense-Sphere Javana arises three times by names
Access - Conformity - Change-of-lineage, Path Consciousness arises once
and Fruit Consciousness arises three times, and then Bhavanga
occurs.</p>
<p><strong>Dull-witted person’s Stream-Entry Path Process</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sharp-witted person’s Stream-Entry Path Process</strong></p>
<p>Na - Da - Ma - U - A - Go - Mā - Pha - Pha - Pha - Bha.</p>
<p>Once-Returning, Non-Returning, and Arahant Path Processes are also
the same. The difference is only the absence of a Change-of-lineage
(<em>Gotrabhū</em>) Citta in them. In those processes, the name
<strong>Cleansing (<em>Vodāna</em>)</strong> is given to the Citta
arising in the place of Change-of-lineage Citta. Its meaning is the
Citta that cleanses by removing defilements obstructing the arising of
Path Consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Dull-witted person’s Once-Returning Path Process</strong></p>
<p>Na - Da - Ma - Pa - U - A - Vo - Mā - Pha - Pha - Bha.</p>
<p><strong>Sharp-witted person’s Process</strong></p>
<p>Na - Da - Ma - U - A - Vo - Mā - Pha - Pha - Pha - Bha.</p>
<p>Remaining processes should be known by this method.</p>
<p><strong>Reviewing Processes</strong></p>
<p>After Path Processes, processes reviewing the Path, reviewing the
Fruit, reviewing Nibbāna, reviewing abandoned defilements, and reviewing
remaining defilements arise. For Arahants, a process reviewing remaining
defilements is not obtained. Vibrating Bhavanga - Arrest Bhavanga -
Mind-door Adverting - seven Reviewing Javanas—this stream of Cittas is
the Reviewing Process. A separate Reviewing Process arises as reviewing
each thing like Path etc.</p>
<p><strong>Fruition Attainment Processes</strong></p>
<p>Fruition Attainment Processes are also forty, like Path Processes.
When the Stream-Enterer wishing to enter his obtained Fruit contemplates
Formations with the hope of entering the Fruit, after Vibrating Bhavanga
- Arrest Bhavanga, Mind-door Adverting Consciousness arises taking
Formations as object and ceases. Following that, taking those very
Formations as object, a Knowledge-Associated Sense-Sphere Wholesome
Citta arises as Conformity Javana four times if the meditator is
Dull-witted, or three times if Sharp-witted, and then Stream-Entry Fruit
Javana arises many times, and then Bhavanga occurs. This is the
Stream-Entry Fruit Attainment Process. There is no limit to the number
of Fruit Cittas arising in Fruit Attainment Processes. Hundreds,
thousands, lakhs, crores of Fruit Cittas can arise in one process. No
matter how many Fruit Cittas arise, the process is the same. Remaining
Fruit Attainment Processes should be understood according to this
Stream-Entry Fruit Attainment Process.</p>

<li>Direct Knowledge Processes - Abhidhamma Mārgaya</li>

<h2 id="direct-knowledge-processes">17. Direct Knowledge Processes</h2>
<p><strong>Lesson 20</strong></p>
<p>There are seven Direct Knowledges (<em>Abhiññā</em>): Divine Eye,
Divine Ear, Supernormal Powers, Knowledge of Others’ Minds, Recollection
of Past Lives, Knowledge of Kamma-based Rebirth
(<em>Yathākammūpaga</em>), and Knowledge of Future
(<em>Anāgataṃsa</em>). Where five Direct Knowledges are mentioned, it is
said so by including Knowledge of Kamma-based Rebirth and Knowledge of
Future in the Divine Eye Direct Knowledge. Before a Direct Knowledge
Process, there is a Base Fifth Jhāna Attainment Process, a Resolution
Process, and again a Base Jhāna Attainment Process. To generate Direct
Knowledge power, first one must enter Jhāna. Since it is the foundation
for Direct Knowledge, it is called <strong>Base Jhāna</strong>
(<em>Pādaka Jhāna</em>).</p>
<p>The Eight Attainment attainer wishing to see something far away with
<strong>Divine Eye Direct Knowledge</strong> enters the Fifth Jhāna in
any one of Fire Kasiṇa, White Kasiṇa, or Light Kasiṇa. Then, rising from
it, he resolves “May such thing be seen.” A Sense-Sphere Javana Process
arises as resolving. Having resolved, he enters the Base Fifth Jhāna
again. After rising from it, the Direct Knowledge Process seeing the
resolved form arises. It is as follows: For the meditator risen from
Base Jhāna, after Vibrating Bhavanga - Arrest Bhavanga, Mind-door
Adverting Consciousness taking the resolved form as object, and
Sense-Sphere Javana arises four times by names Preparation - Access -
Conformity - Change-of-lineage, and then the Direct Knowledge
Consciousness arises once seeing the distant form as if seeing with the
eye and ceases. After that, Bhavanga occurs. This is the Divine Eye
Direct Knowledge Process.</p>
<p><strong>Dull-witted person’s Divine Eye Direct Knowledge
Process</strong></p>
<p>Na - Da - Ma - Pa - U - A - Go - Abhiññā - Bha</p>
<p><strong>Sharp-witted person’s Process</strong></p>
<p>Na - Da - Ma - U - A - Go - Abhiññā - Bha</p>
<p>It is said that Light Kasiṇa is better for making base for Direct
Knowledges like Divine Eye. For Supernormal Powers Direct Knowledge
(<em>Iddhividha</em>), the Fifth Jhāna taking Earth Kasiṇa as object is
made the base.</p>
<p><strong>Cessation Attainment Process</strong></p>
<p>When the Non-Returner or Arahant person who has developed Mastery in
the Eight Attainments wishes to enter Cessation Attainment, starting
from the First Jhāna, he enters the Jhānas in order up to
Ākiñcaññāyatana Jhāna and observes their formations as impermanent etc.
with insight. Then, when the preliminary duties of Cessation Attainment
are done and finished, after Vibrating Bhavanga and Arrest Bhavanga,
Mind-door Adverting Consciousness arises, and Sense-Sphere Javana arises
four or three times by names Preparation, Access, Conformity,
Change-of-lineage, and then Nevasaññānāsaññāyatana Jhāna Consciousness
arises twice, and the stream of consciousness cuts off.</p>
<p>Throughout the time expected by the meditator, Cittas and Mind-born
Rūpas do not exist, only the remaining Rūpas exist. As soon as the
expected time passes, without an adverting, if the person entered is a
Non-Returner, Non-Returning Fruit Consciousness arises once; if an
Arahant person, Arahant Fruit Consciousness arises once. After that,
Bhavanga occurs. This is the Cessation Attainment Process.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="the-process-of-the-attainment-of-cessation">18. The Process of
the Attainment of Cessation</h2>
<p>Na - Da - Ma - Pa - U - A - Go - Jhāna - Jhāna - Mindless Time -
Fruit - Bha.</p>
<p>For the Sharp-witted person, this process arises without Preparation
Javana.</p>
<p>When the person entering Cessation Attainment enters the
Nevasaññānāsaññāyatana Jhāna, unlike in other Attainment Processes where
the Jhāna Consciousness arises continuously like Bhavanga Consciousness,
it arises only twice and cuts off due to the power of the preparation
done to prevent the arising of Cittas. Entering Jhānas in order starting
from the First Jhāna and observing their formations with insight is also
the preparation for stopping the arising of Cittas.</p>
<p>Even if they are Eight Attainment attainers, Worldlings and
Stream-Entry and Once-Returning persons cannot enter Cessation
Attainment because Sensual Lust, which is an obstacle to concentration,
is not abandoned in them. Entering Cessation Attainment exists only in
Sense World and Fine-Material World. It does not exist in the Immaterial
World. The absence of Fine-Material-sphere Attainments there is the
cause for the absence of Cessation Attainment in the Immaterial
World.</p>
